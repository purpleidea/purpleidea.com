The company:
I&rsquo;ve officially started a company. I&rsquo;ve been working on this for some time now, and it&rsquo;s time to let you all know about it officially. As you already know (mgmt, purpleidea, etc&hellip;) I&rsquo;ve never been great at naming.</p>

	<hr>
	<p>I&rsquo;ve been using git status for quite a long time now. Let&rsquo;s make it better.
My old aliases:
My ~/.gitconfig has had:
[alias] s = status d = diff l = log --show-signature for as long as I can remember. They&rsquo;ve served me well.
The problem:
In one of my projects, I occasionally have a bunch of untracked files, particularly when I&rsquo;m hacking on something new that isn&rsquo;t committed yet. This may include notes, new tests, and so on.</p>

	</h4>
	<hr>
	<p>Want to tunnel etcd traffic over SSH? Here&rsquo;s a pitfall I ran into.
The problem:
Mgmt supports tunnelling the etcd traffic over SSH. This is quite useful, because it means that for it to connect to etcd, it doesn&rsquo;t need to open up any new ports other than 22.
You can run the agent like so:
mgmt run --ssh-url=etcd@etcdserver:22 --seeds=http://127.0.0.1:2379 --no-server --no-magic empty and it just works!
Lockdown:
It&rsquo;s no fun giving out more access than is really necessary, so I added this line to the etcd user account in their ~/.</p>

	<p>iPXE is a terrific tool, but despite their very respectable documentation, it has some rough edges, and it still feels like an &ldquo;in crowd&rdquo; kind of thing, where you have to learn the common tricks by knowing someone.
The problem:
I&rsquo;ve been building a provisioning tool in mgmt and instead of always relying on distro-specific boot images, I decided to use iPXE to handle the early boot, and have it hand-off to the kernel installer.</p>

		<small>Understanding mgmt modules, imports, and entry points</small>
	</h4>
	<hr>
	<p>Mgmt modules are used for structuring your code across multiple files. This keeps things readable and allows for code reusability. For example, it should be easy to write a single module which can be effectively used by many different parties. To me, it never felt like code reuse was a core design objective with other tools. In mgmt it has been since the very beginning. I&rsquo;m very proud of our module system, so let me introduce you to it properly.</p>

It took some time to finally solve that properly. Since then I&rsquo;ve been working to get mgmt production ready. It&rsquo;s properly useful for production now, and so it&rsquo;s time for me to catch up on my documentation.</p>

xkcd reminds us that we&#39;re insane Prefixes:
My first tip involves using a memorable prefix. For new features I name my branches with feat/. For example feat/my-new-feature. Yes the slash and the dashes are treated like any regular character.</p>

	<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing some massively concurrent code for mgmt lately. The concurrency makes it incredibly bug prone. In this case it&rsquo;s usually races or deadlocks. I&rsquo;ve got a new trick to make the process more pleasant.

	<hr>
	<p>I decided to write a fancy test harness in golang today. The test wraps a big internal engine for mgmt and at the top-level it takes a context for cancellation.

The Problem:
I assumed there would be some way to follow a notification from the test runner down into my test to tell it when it was time to cleanup and exit early&hellip; I expected that making my own ^C signal handler wouldn&rsquo;t be correct, and I (incorrectly) assumed that the interface I&rsquo;d be looking for would offer a golang context that I could pass into my code.</p>

	<p>Transportation is very important to me. My whole life I&rsquo;ve never owned a car. I have gotten by with biking, public transit, and various car sharing services. Sadly, biking is incredibly dangerous and stressful, because most cars don&rsquo;t respect bicycles, and in the winter it&rsquo;s not very practical, the STM (public transit) offers an incredibly unreliable and unpleasant service, and Car2Go (car sharing) now requires that you use their proprietary smart phone app (you used to be able to just swipe the membership card) so I finally gave up and decided to buy a used car.</p>

		<small>Class and Include statements in the Mgmt Configuration Language</small>
	</h4>
	<hr>
	<p>It&rsquo;s been a little over a year since I introduced the Mgmt Configuration Language. A lot has happened since then, and I&rsquo;d like to introduce some of the missing features that weren&rsquo;t available when the language was first introduced. If you haven&rsquo;t already read that post, please start there and come back when you&rsquo;re finished. In this article we&rsquo;ll learn about classes.
Classes:
You might remember that the mgmt language called mcl has both statements, and expressions.</p>

	<p>mgmt @ FOSDEM:
Later today I&rsquo;m giving four talks about mgmt at FOSDEM. I&rsquo;m also giving two more on the following day. (One is a 5 min lightning talk.) I don&rsquo;t know how I got accepted for so many talks, I just replied to the CFP for every room where I thought I had something interesting to share, and well, here we are!
I got rejected for the main track again, but I guess it&rsquo;s up to me to make my work more generally appealing first.</p>
