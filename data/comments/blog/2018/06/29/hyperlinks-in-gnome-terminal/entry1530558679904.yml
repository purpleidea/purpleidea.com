message: "Sometimes a terminal application makes use of the right-click for its own purposes. E.g., vim typically uses right-click to mark the end of a visual selection. Thus when using vim, any URLs in the document are underlined as a hyperlink, but right-clicking doesn't show the terminal's menu.\r\n\r\nTip: in this case, holding Shift down while right-clicking will present the terminal's context menu, allowing you to open the hyperlink."
