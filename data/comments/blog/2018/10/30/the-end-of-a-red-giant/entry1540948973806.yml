message: "Out of the list of 7 projects you list under permissive licenses, 4 have licenses decided by group external to Red hat (Openstack, Docker, Opendaylight, Kubernetes). If your position is to not collaborate because the license is not what you want, this go kinda against the concept of collaboration at the root of free software.\r\n\r\nAnd out of the last 3, openshift is basically a fork of kubernetes with more objects, with the long term goal  of pushing the changes in kubernetes (so same license is kinda needed ), manageiq is under permissive because partners wanted to be able to add proprietary ruby add-ons without using the GPL (I actually worked on that part 4 years ago), and because that's what ruby devs actually prefer. And in both case, that would would count as \"community decided\" (because we also have to be honest, there is very few individuals who would want to spent their free time on a multi cloud management systems, so you kinda have to rely on others companys, or pay people for that).\r\n\r\nAnd there is Ovirt, which is under AL2, and I suspect this might have been either a preference from the JBoss folks and/or a plan for getting it pushed to Apache Fundation and/or just a preference of the folks who did worked on that, since we had a lot of people from the ASF in the team at that time.\r\n\r\nThere is a argument to make about why the industry as a whole prefer the BSD/MIT license for sure. But that's not the argument you are making, quite far from it.\r\n\r\nIt is also quite ironic that you qualify Kubernetes and Docker of project with lots of marketing when your own blog is likely hosted on it (cf https://githubengineering.com/kubernetes-at-github/ ), and that your main project is built on a CI using docker (or at least, that was using docker at the start, they switch to VM at the start of the month, and now use GCE)."
