  There's a magic git command (that I can't remember) that prints out the top
  level directory for the repo you are in. You could use that either to stop the
  loop earlier (avoid hitting $HOME or any other intermediaries), or skip the
  loop altogether and use it to jump straight to the root Makefile location.
