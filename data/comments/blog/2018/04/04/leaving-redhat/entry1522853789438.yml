  I feel that I might have played some small part in your coming to Red Hat, and
  perhaps in the reasons why you left as well. I hope that it was a good
  experience for you overall, though I know there were some rough spots. I wish
  you well, and hope our paths cross again some day so I can get the rest of the
  story. And thanks for the bagels. :)
