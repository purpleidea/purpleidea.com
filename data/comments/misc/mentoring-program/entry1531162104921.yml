  I began with James' mentoring program in its infancy in mid-2017. Being an
  overstretched student, I wasn't able to keep up with it, but anyone who has
  the time to put in will definitely get good returns on their investment. Even
  in the very brief time that I was trying to participate, I gained a lot of
  invaluable knowledge. I wish I was able to continue; I could see he had big
  plans. If you disagree with the ideology of free software, however, be warned
  you're bound to have more than a few clashes with James. But you probably
  already knew that if you're considering this program.
