I DJ occasionally. Mostly for fun, as I like to put on a good show. I invest
almost 100% of my performance fees into paying for show consumables (fire,
smoke, bubbles, etc...) and for buying new equipment to improve the shows.

I play almost entirely Old School Hip-Hop and Rap, combined with some Break
Beats and occasional slow jams.

If you'd like to hire me to play at your bar, club, or venue, please [contact me](/contact/).
I'm happy to play weddings, funerals, and other private events as well.
I'm happy to perform at fundraising events for non-profits at cost if I can.
