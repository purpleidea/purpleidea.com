### History

In 1988, a group of individuals got together to run an annual free dinner for
anyone in need. The dinner welcomed poor, homeless, lonely, low income, or
anyone otherwise in need of a free meal.

In 1994, my mother, Susan Clarke, took over the organization of the annual
dinner. Around that time, I started helping out, but as a very young child, I
don't know how helpful I actually was. Over the years I helped out with various
tasks, until I eventually ended up taking over the running of the kitchen. My
father took over the organizational running of the dinner many years later. In
2025 I officially took his place as the core responsable for the event, with a
goal of getting more people involved in main planning and execution.
