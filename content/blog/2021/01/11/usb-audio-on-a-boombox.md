In an earlier post, [I got USB audio working on my used, manual, 2013 Honda Civic EX](/blog/2020/08/11/usb-car-audio-in-a-civic/).
Today I'll do the same for a Sony ZS-RS60BT [boombox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boombox).

{{< blog-image src="boombox.jpg" caption="Here it is in all its used glory after a little cleaning." scale="100%" >}}

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Background" >}}

I decided I should get a small portable boombox to practice my [dope dance moves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popping).
I currently still suck because I think I spend more time computering than out on
the floor. In any case, in a stroke of luck, I happened upon a used boombox that
was getting discarded due to a broken CD player. Nobody seemed either able or
interested in getting USB audio working, so I took it home and gave it a go!

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Initial attempts" >}}

Some initial attempts at formatting the USB key ended up with this:

{{< blog-image src="nodev.jpg" caption="The device printing a NO DEV message." scale="100%" >}}

Others got it showing a marquee message of "NOT SUPPORT".

{{< blog-image src="not.jpg" caption="NOT!" scale="100%" >}}

{{< blog-image src="support.jpg" caption="... NOT SUPPORT" scale="100%" >}}

Hmmm, I guess we have to go really old school here.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Identification" >}}

The code inside this thing must be really old. So after some digging, I found
out the magic incantation. The device expects a drive with a single partition,
labelled in a magic way.

My usb drive was `/dev/sdb`. You can find this out by watching `dmesg --follow`
when you put it in...

```bash
# dmesg --follow
[143018.765853] usb 2-1: new SuperSpeed Gen 1 USB device number 5 using xhci_hcd

...or by being clever and looking through `lsblk`.

```bash
# lsblk
NAME                                          MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINT
[snip]

```

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Partitioning" >}}

I popped open `fdisk` next. You can use `p` to print the current state. You can
type `m` for the menu. You'll want to use `n` to make a new partition, then use
all the defaults. After that you'll need to change the partition type with `t`.
The code we want is `W95 FAT32` which is represented by a `b`. Select that and
then exit with `w` to write everything to disk. My logs of this are included:

```bash
james@computer:~$ sudo fdisk /dev/sdb

Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.35.2).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Filesystem" >}}

Finally, let's build a filesystem.

```bash
# mkfs.vfat -F 32 -n BREAKBEATS /dev/sdb1
mkfs.fat 4.1 (2017-01-24)
```

Make sure that your label is all UPPERCASE if you decide to use one. After this
I mounted the partition, and copied over some non-copyrighted mp3's to it. It
will even read into nested folders.

You might want to consider using `fatsort -n /dev/sdb1` if you want to get
things playing in their desired filesystem order. I explained this in my earlier
[car audio article](/blog/2020/08/11/usb-car-audio-in-a-civic/). For this
use-case, I didn't bother to because all my break beats are random tracks that
don't have a particular album order anyways!

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Battery life" >}}

When plugged-in or running off of batteries, there is a small amount of
[phantom draw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standby_power), so I take out one
battery when it's not in use. (The 6x1.5V C cell's are in series, so you can
remove any of them to disconnect the circuit.)

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Conclusion" >}}

As a bonus, it even comes with a storage drawer for your AUX cable and extra USB
drives!

{{< blog-image src="open.jpg" caption="Store some stuff here if you don't care about breaking the CD player!" scale="100%" >}}

And here's one last thing to make you all jealous... My machine's volume can go
[up to eleven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to_eleven).

{{< blog-image src="11.jpg" caption="Up to eleven!" scale="100%" >}}

If anyone in the Montreal area wants to break/pop with me, [please say hi](/contact/).

Happy Hacking,

James
