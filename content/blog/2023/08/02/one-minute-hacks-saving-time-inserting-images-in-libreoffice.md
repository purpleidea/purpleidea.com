You've probably used libreoffice. You opened a document, and proceeded to insert
an image into the text. It wiggles all over and never rests where you want it
to.

You most likely want the "anchor as character" option. Right-click on the newly
inserted image, go to the `Anchor` menu item, and choose `As Character`. You
will have to do this for each image you insert which is annoying...

{{< blog-paragraph-header "The default" >}}

It turns out that you can choose a different default!

{{< blog-image src="arrow-default.png" alt="Here's the global default for all sessions." scale="100%" >}}

It can be found in: `Tools` -> `Options` -> `LibreOffice Writer` -> `Formatting Aids`.

In case you didn't know, you can also drag images into the document, or even hit
"copy" in your favourite image program or even "copy image" in firefox, and then
hit paste in libreoffice to pull in the image.

I hope you enjoyed this. I must admit I didn't know there was a default setting
for over ten years. I finally discovered it today. I hope it saves you some
years.

Happy Hacking,

James
