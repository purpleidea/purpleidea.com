I decided to write a fancy test harness in golang today. The test wraps a big
internal engine for [mgmt](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/) and at the
top-level it takes a [context](https://pkg.go.dev/context) for cancellation. If
you don't know about the `context` package, then you should go understand that
and then come back here... Don't feel bad, I had no idea what it was about at
first either!

{{< blog-paragraph-header "The Problem" >}}

I assumed there would be some way to follow a notification from the test runner
down into my test to tell it when it was time to cleanup and exit early... I
expected that making my own `^C` signal handler wouldn't be correct, and I
(incorrectly) assumed that the interface I'd be looking for would offer a golang
`context` that I could pass into my code. I was wrong, but I was on the right
track and it did help me find what I was looking for. Let me explain the subtlety...

{{< blog-paragraph-header "The Subtlety" >}}

Tests often run with a bounded duration. This can either be infinite, or it can
be a fixed number of seconds. For example, you could run a single test with a 42
second timeout by doing:

```bash
go test -timeout 42s github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/util/deadline -run TestSlowTest1
```

or you might let an entire test package run for up to five minutes instead:

```bash
go test -timeout 5m github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/util/deadline -v
```

When that timeout elapses, golang will force a panic and immediately shut it all
down. You might think it would be useful to have it cancel a `context`, but
there's no guarantee things would shutdown right away-- we are testing after
all, and deadlocks are a common issue that we look for. They're even often found
in the cleanup path!

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Simple Cleanup" >}}

For the situation where you only care about the `context` in terms of cleaning
up your test when it's complete, it is quite simple to add to the top of each
test:

```golang
func TestCleanup1(t *testing.T) {
	wg := &sync.WaitGroup{}
	defer wg.Wait()
	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel() // cleanup

	// use ctx and wg.Add/wg.Done down here...
}
```

{{< blog-paragraph-header "The Deadline Approach" >}}

The testing package provides a [Deadline](https://pkg.go.dev/testing#T.Deadline)
method which when called, tells you what time the timeout will destroy your
world. If you're in the mood to, you can have a look at this and shut things
down early. Here's the API and documentation on the subject:

```golang
func (t *T) Deadline() (deadline time.Time, ok bool)
```

_Deadline reports the time at which the test binary will have exceeded the
timeout specified by the -timeout flag. The ok result is false if the -timeout
flag indicates “no timeout” (0)._

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Boilerplate" >}}

How would I use this in practice? There wasn't an obvious example handy, so I
cooked one up. It looks like this:

```golang
func TestDeadlineTimeout1(t *testing.T) {
	min := time.Second * 3 // approx min time needed for the test
	ctx := context.Background()
	if deadline, ok := t.Deadline(); ok {
		d := deadline.Add(-min)
		newCtx, cancel := context.WithDeadline(ctx, d)
		ctx = newCtx
		defer cancel()
	}

	select {
	case <-ctx.Done():
		time.Sleep(min - (1 * time.Second)) // one second less for safety
	}
}
```

In this example, I define a minimum amount of time that I need for my test. I
also start off with a top-level `context`. Next I get the actual deadline that
golang has defined for me. Keep in mind that this value is likely shared across
all of the tests, so don't be greedy! Then I subtract that minimum and setup a
new `context`. The new `context` will get cancelled if you're within that many
seconds from the final `panic()` timeout.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Examples" >}}

Let's run a few examples to make sure this works as we intended it to. The
package contains a fixed-duration three second test, and the fancy test seen
above, but with some added logging. The full code example can be seen below.

```bash
james@computer:~/code/mgmt$ go test -timeout 10s github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/util/deadline -v
=== RUN   TestSlowTest1
--- PASS: TestSlowTest1 (3.00s)
=== RUN   TestDeadlineTimeout1
    deadline_test.go:37:   now: 2023-02-24 22:01:21.57705789 -0500 EST m=+3.002741019
    deadline_test.go:38:     d: 2023-02-24 22:01:25.57452127 -0500 EST m=+7.000204332
    deadline_test.go:46:   ctx: 2023-02-24 22:01:25.577851787 -0500 EST m=+7.003534903
    deadline_test.go:48: sleep: 2023-02-24 22:01:27.578795977 -0500 EST m=+9.004479068
--- PASS: TestDeadlineTimeout1 (6.00s)
PASS
ok  	github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/util/deadline	9.006s
```

Here we can see that given ten seconds, our fixed-duration test finished in
three, and our "smart" (but greedy) test took an additional six. It left us with
one second to spare before the panic!

```bash
james@computer:~/code/mgmt$ go test -timeout 6s github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/util/deadline -v
=== RUN   TestSlowTest1
--- PASS: TestSlowTest1 (3.00s)
=== RUN   TestDeadlineTimeout1
    deadline_test.go:37:   now: 2023-02-24 22:01:47.391144074 -0500 EST m=+3.001178645
    deadline_test.go:38:     d: 2023-02-24 22:01:47.39014766 -0500 EST m=+3.000182129
    deadline_test.go:46:   ctx: 2023-02-24 22:01:47.391900938 -0500 EST m=+3.001935477
    deadline_test.go:48: sleep: 2023-02-24 22:01:49.392791585 -0500 EST m=+5.002826154
--- PASS: TestDeadlineTimeout1 (2.00s)
PASS
ok  	github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/util/deadline	5.005s
```

Here with much less time to spare, our fancy test only took two seconds to run.
If you run this yourself, note when the `ctx` log message shows up; you'll see
it appear instantly!

```bash
james@computer:~/code/mgmt$ go test -timeout 4s github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/util/deadline -v
=== RUN   TestSlowTest1
--- PASS: TestSlowTest1 (3.00s)

```

Lastly, in this scenario, things could never finish in four seconds and the
test runner caused everything to panic. It correctly propagated a failure exit
code as well.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Code" >}}

Here's what the full code looks like. It's surprisingly short. Put this into
a `deadline_test.go` somewhere, and have fun experimenting with it!

```golang
// Package deadline_test has examples to test the testing deadline system.
package deadline_test

import (
	"context"
	"testing"
	"time"
)

func TestSlowTest1(t *testing.T) {
	time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
}

func TestDeadlineTimeout1(t *testing.T) {
	now := time.Now()
	min := time.Second * 3 // approx min time needed for the test
	ctx := context.Background()
	if deadline, ok := t.Deadline(); ok {
		d := deadline.Add(-min)
		t.Logf("  now: %+v", now)
		t.Logf("    d: %+v", d)
		newCtx, cancel := context.WithDeadline(ctx, d)
		ctx = newCtx
		defer cancel()
	}

	select {
	case <-ctx.Done():
		t.Logf("  ctx: %+v", time.Now())
		time.Sleep(min - (1 * time.Second)) // one second less for safety
		t.Logf("sleep: %+v", time.Now())
	}
}
```

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Improvements" >}}

I think it would be more elegant to be able to get a `context` from the
[testing.T](https://pkg.go.dev/testing#T) type, but it would only make sense
under the guise of a "approaching the test timeout limit" and that would be a
whole other parameter we'd have to pass through, and of course it would maybe be
something that we'd want to be different with each test or subtest, and so the
aforementioned mechanism makes this all doable, even if it's a bit more verbose.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "References" >}}

The best reference is here in [this issue for the deadline implementation](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/28135).
You can see that they even had a tentative `Context` API added, but this was
later removed. I didn't dig too deeply, but I found it funny that they didn't
add a clear example on how to use `Deadline` in your tests. I'd send a patch if
doing so wasn't fraught with [CLA's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement).
