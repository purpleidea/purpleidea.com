I've been writing some massively concurrent code for [mgmt](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/)
lately. The concurrency makes it incredibly bug prone. In this case it's usually
races or deadlocks. I've got a new trick to make the process more pleasant.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "The Problem" >}}

I'm sure many of you have written some code like this before:

```golang
// just a small excerpt
for {
	select {
	case <-someEvent:
		// some awesome thing happened!
	case <-ctx.Done():
		return ctx.Err()
	}
}
```

And during debugging, you might have gotten frustrated and added some printf's:

```golang
for {
	fmt.Printf("XXX: about to select...\n")
	select {
	case <-someEvent:
		fmt.Printf("XXX: received event!\n")
		// some awesome thing happened!
	case <-ctx.Done():
		fmt.Printf("XXX: errored with: %+v\n", err)
		return ctx.Err()
	}
}
```

I know I've done this a lot. In fact, I've occasionally added some permanent
logging in some of these situations. The problem is, that most of the time, when
I'm running in these fast loops, I don't care about seeing those messages. I
usually only care about those messages when something is stuck! Otherwise it's
just noise.

{{< blog-image src="eddie.jpg" alt="I wish I could avoid concurrency and locking, but here we are!" scale="100%" >}}

{{< blog-paragraph-header "The Solution" >}}

I'd like to add a `printf`, but I'd only like it to appear if I'm still waiting
for that `select` for more than some number of seconds. When I "get past" the
`select`, I don't care about printing that message anymore. I wrote up a small
utility library to do this. Here's what the new code looks like:

{{< blog-paragraph-header "The Example" >}}

```golang
import "github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/util"

for {
	bt := util.BlockedTimer{Seconds: 2}
	defer bt.Cancel() // free memory (prevent one goroutine leak)
	bt.Printf("XXX: about to select...\n")
	select {
	case <-someEvent:
		bt.Cancel() // no need to print anymore!
		fmt.Printf("XXX: received event!\n")
		// some awesome thing happened!
	case <-ctx.Done():
		fmt.Printf("XXX: errored with: %+v\n", err)
		return ctx.Err()
	}
}
```

We first setup the timer, and in this example I wanted two seconds. Just as in
the [context](https://godocs.io/context) package, we need to make sure to free
it when done so that we don't leak goroutines. As soon as the `bt.Printf`
statement is run, then a timer for that `Printf` starts. If we `Cancel` it
before those two seconds are up, then nothing is printed. If we delay too long,
then we'll see the message, and we'll know which part of our code is blocking!

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Duration vs. Seconds" >}}

If you'd prefer to specify an exact duration instead of a time in seconds, then
use the `Duration` field instead. That will work how you expect. The `Seconds`
field is meant as a shorthand for the most common use-case.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Run instead of Printf" >}}

I wrote the utility to be slightly more generic. Instead of `Printf` you can
also use `Run`. The latter takes an arbitrary function to run instead. This is
useful for when you want to run a `t.Logf` when you're inside of a test, or in
some other scenario. For testing this library, I actually use `Run` and a
channel signal. There are many other uses for run as well.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Multiple" >}}

After you've initialized the `BlockedTimer` struct, you can call a mixture of
`Printf` and `Run` as many times as you like. They'll each get their own timer,
and they'll each run individually. When you run the `Cancel` method, all of
those that are still waiting will shutdown.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Corner cases and safety" >}}

It's completely safe to call this concurrently. You can call the `Cancel`
function as many times as you'd like. If you've called `Printf` or `Run` then
you should definitely call `Cancel` at least once to avoid a goroutine leak.

The copying semantics are identical to the [sync.Mutex](https://godocs.io/sync#Mutex)
package in that if you don't create this as a pointer, then it "must not be
copied after first use".

It's pretty hard to break this! Have fun!

{{< blog-paragraph-header "The code" >}}

The code is available [here](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/blob/master/util/bt.go).
I hope you find it as useful in your projects as I have.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Alternatives" >}}

The [time](https://godocs.io/time) package has an `AfterFunc(d Duration, f func()) *Timer`
function included. This is almost identical to what I've implemented. The main
downside is that you can only have a single action, and it's much more verbose.
It's not entirely clear to me from the docs which parts are thread-safe and
which aren't, but if you want to do it, it might look like this:

```golang
import "time"

for {
	af := time.AfterFunc{time.Duration(2) * time.Second, func() { fmt.Printf("XXX: about to select...\n") } }
	defer af.Stop()
	select {
	case <-someEvent:
		af.Stop()
		fmt.Printf("XXX: received event!\n")
		// some awesome thing happened!
	case <-ctx.Done():
		fmt.Printf("XXX: errored with: %+v\n", err)
		return ctx.Err()
	}
}
```

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Non-debugging cases" >}}

In one of the pieces of code I'm working on, I have a bunch of workers that all
start up. They are arranged into a [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph).
A worker that is slow or blocked will prevent anyone downstream of it from
starting up. As a result, I can use this library to notify the user which
particular workers still haven't initialized if we're waiting for more than a
few seconds. This is a much better user experience than wondering if you have a
deadlock in your code.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Stacktraces to find out where you're blocked" >}}

An important reminder: If you're only interested in debugging scenarios, you can
also rely on stacktraces to find out where you are blocked. In my
[debugging golang programs](/blog/2016/02/15/debugging-golang-programs/) post,
you will remember that at any point, you can press *Control+Backslash* and you
should get a full stacktrace of where each goroutine is waiting.

I hope you enjoyed this. Please leave me a comment if this taught you something
new!

Happy Hacking,
