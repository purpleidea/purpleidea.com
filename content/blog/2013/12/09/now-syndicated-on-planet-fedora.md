I'm now syndicated on the <a href="http://planet.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Project planet</a>. If you haven't read through <a href="/blog/">my blog</a> yet, let me introduce myself, I'm <a href="http://purpleidea.fedorapeople.org/">James</a>, and I write <strong><a href="/blog/">The Technical Blog of James</a></strong>.

I'm a sysadmin, DevOps/Puppet hacker, I.T./network architect and physiologist. Hi! I run Fedora as my primary desktop, but I also use it for servers, particularly for development before future versions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux">RHEL</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS">CentOS</a> release.

I'm most well-known for <a title="puppet-gluster" href="https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-gluster/">Puppet-Gluster</a>, but I've also written a decent <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-ipa">Puppet-IPA</a> (<a href="http://www.freeipa.org/">FreeIPA</a>) module. I'm currently working on porting Puppet-Gluster to Fedora and looking forward to the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/20/Schedule">upcoming release of Fedora 20</a>.

Please feel free to comment or <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> and tell me which articles you like, and which you don't. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/purpleidea">I'm on Twitter</a>, and on IRC as <em>purpleidea</em>.

Happy hacking,

James
