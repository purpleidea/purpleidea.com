Ironically, one of the reasons that I started writing Puppet code, was so that I could spend more time designing and building, and less time writing documentation. I suppose I'm a victim of my success, because <a title="puppet-gluster" href="https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-gluster/">Puppet-Gluster</a> has grown large enough to warrant its own documentation.

So I gave in, and put together some documentation.

<a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-gluster/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md">It's available as markdown</a>, and, <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-gluster/raw/master/puppet-gluster-documentation.pdf">also as a pdf</a>. As before, there is an <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-gluster/tree/master/examples">examples/ directory</a> which you might want to use as additional reference.

Please send me <a title="contact" href="/contact/">feedback</a>! I want to hear about any parts you found confusing, spelling and/or grammar fixes, and any other information that you think I should add.

The documentation is also mirrored at the <a href="https://forge.gluster.org/puppet-gluster/puppet-gluster/trees/master">gluster forge</a>.

Happy hacking,

James
