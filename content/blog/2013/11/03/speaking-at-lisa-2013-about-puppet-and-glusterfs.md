I'm speaking at <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13">LISA 2013</a>, the "Large Installation System Administration" conference. This conference runs all week in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_DC">Washington</a>. I'll be giving two talks during the week, and attending at least one BOF.

My first talk is on Monday during the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13/gluster-community-day">Gluster Community Day</a>. I'll be speaking about <a title="puppet-gluster" href="https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-gluster/">puppet-gluster</a>, and giving a live demo. I'll be showing some new features too. If you'd like to talk more about puppet-gluster, or want to attend the talk, give me a shout, or sign up at the above <em>Gluster Community Day</em> link.

On Tuesday, I'll be giving a talk during <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13/puppet-camp-dc">Puppet Camp DC</a>. My talk will be about "<em>Pushing Puppet</em> (to the limit)". I've prepared lots of fun puppet hacks, and live demos, so I expect you'll thoroughly enjoy this.

I've got lots of technical hacks, and <a title="github" href="https://github.com/purpleidea/">great code that I've published</a> lately, but that I haven't blogged about yet. If you follow along with my git commits, you'll be able to figure out most of it, but I've got a bunch of articles coming anyways.

Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmark">John Mark</a> and <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">RedHat</a> for sponsoring my trip, <a href="https://twitter.com/geekygirldawn">Dawn Foster</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/FeyNudibranch">Kara Sowles</a> for organizing my Puppet talk and <a href="http://twitter.com/lisaconference">Hilary Hartman</a> at USENIX for helping me register.

Happy Hacking,

James

PS: If you're at LISA 2013, and you want to buy me dinner and get some light Puppet or Gluster consulting, <a title="contact" href="/contact/">contact me</a>! You can also give me a shout if you just want to talk tech. If anyone wants to meet up and hack on things, please let me know too.
