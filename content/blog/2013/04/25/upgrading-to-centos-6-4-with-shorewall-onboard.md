In case you upgrade your CentOS 6.x box to version 6.4, the shorewall service might complain. With a scary message:
```
ERROR: Your kernel/iptables do not include state match support.
No version of Shorewall will run on this system
```
This is selinux at work, and the problem can easily be solved by running:
```
# restorecon -Rv /sbin
```
Thanks shorewall-users and

Happy hacking,

James
