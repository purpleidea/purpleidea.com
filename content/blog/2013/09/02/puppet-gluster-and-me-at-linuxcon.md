<a href="http://www.johnmark.org/blog/">John Mark Walker</a>, (from <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Redhat</a>) has been kind enough to invite me to speak at the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-north-america/program/co-located-events">Linuxcon Gluster Workshop</a> in <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-north-america/extend-the-experience/about-new-orleans">New Orleans</a>. I'll be speaking about <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-gluster">puppet-gluster</a>, giving demos, and hopefully showing off some new features. I'm also looking forward to meeting up with <a href="http://www.gluster.org/">gluster</a> expert <a href="http://joejulian.name/">Joe Julian</a>.

If there are features that puppet-gluster is missing, or you have a use case that I haven't covered, please let me know, and I'll try to work on it for you ahead of the conference. If you want to meet up for some puppet-gluster help, or to hack on code, I'll be around from the 16th to the 20th of September. My talk is on the 19th.

Special thanks to John Mark and Redhat for sponsoring this trip. Without them, none of this would be possible.

Happy hacking,

James
