so the idea was to open this up to sys admins in other mcgill departments, so if we don't know about you, drop us a <a href="mailto:james@cs.mcgill.ca">line</a> and we'll get you added to the blog. if people like the idea, then we'll host this on a better cs machine than <a href="http://dazzle.cs.mcgill.ca/">dazzle</a>.
