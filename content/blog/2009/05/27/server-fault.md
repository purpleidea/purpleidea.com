<a href="http://serverfault.com/">Server Fault</a>, the question and answer forum for systems administrators opened their doors today to the public. It is created by the same notorious bloggers who brought you <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a> and the <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">Daily WTF</a>.

Go have a look, ask a question, answer a question and have fun!
