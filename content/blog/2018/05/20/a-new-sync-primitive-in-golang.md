I've been working on lots of new stuff in [mgmt](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/)
and I had a synchronization problem that needed solving... Long story short, I
built it into a piece of re-usable functionality, exactly like you might find in
the _[sync](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/)_ package. For details and examples,
please continue reading...

{{< blog-paragraph-header "The Problem" >}}

I want to multicast a signal to an arbitrary number of goroutines. As you might
already know, this can already be done with a `chan struct{}`. You simply
`close` the channel to send the signal, and anyone running a `select` on that
channel will return when it closes.

I'd like to do all of that, however I'd also like for the initiating close
signal to wait until everyone has `acknowledged` the multicast signal before it
continues.

Lastly, I'd like for this to be re-usable in that I'd like this to work for
another cycle after the first `syn-ack` iteration finishes.

Feel free to pause reading if you'd like to try building this on your own first.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Code" >}}

Here's what the code looks like. It's surprisingly short.

```golang
type SubscribedSignal struct {
	wg    sync.WaitGroup
	exit  chan struct{}
	mutex sync.RWMutex
}

func (obj *SubscribedSignal) Subscribe() (<-chan struct{}, func()) {
	obj.mutex.Lock()
	defer obj.mutex.Unlock()

	if obj.exit == nil { // initialize on first use (safe b/c we use a lock)
		obj.exit = make(chan struct{}) // initialize
	}

	obj.wg.Add(1)
	return obj.exit, func() { // cancel/ack function
		obj.wg.Done()

		// wait for the reset signal before proceeding
		obj.mutex.RLock()
		defer obj.mutex.RUnlock()
	}
}

func (obj *SubscribedSignal) Send() {
	obj.mutex.Lock()
	defer obj.mutex.Unlock()

	if obj.exit != nil { // in case we Send before anyone runs Subscribe
		close(obj.exit) // send the close signal
	}
	obj.wg.Wait() // wait for everyone to ack

	obj.exit = make(chan struct{}) // reset

	// release (re-use the above mutex)
}
```

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Explanation" >}}

You start by creating the zero value of the struct with `&SubscribedSignal{}`.
You can then `Subscribe` to it any number of times. When `Subscribe` returns,
you can guarantee that you are now successfully subscribed. It will return two
values:

The first is the multicast channel which closes when the signal is sent. You can
wait on this channel in a `select` statement.

The second is an acknowledge (`ack`) function which you *must* run after you
have received the signal or if you are no longer interested in waiting for the
signal and you wish to cancel.

Once the signal is sent via `Send`, it will only unblock and terminate once all
the subscribed signals have replied by running their individual `ack` functions.
If you do not do so, you will block indefinitely.

At this point it is safe to run `Subscribe` again and repeat the process.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Sneaky Races" >}}

Keep in mind that these types of problems have some sneaky races. For example,
if the `cancel/ack` function didn't have the read lock, then the system wouldn't
wait for all the individual subscribed workers to `ack` before continuing. It's
preferable that it is a read lock so that they're all released simultaneously,
instead of sequentially which depending on your containing code could cause a
deadlock. This made it tricky to come up with, but elegant now that it's done.
I was particularly happy that I was able to reuse the `mutex`, so that only one
was necessary.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Example" >}}

Here's a full usage example in the golang testable
[example](https://blog.golang.org/examples) format:

```golang
func ExampleSubscribeSync() {
	fmt.Println("hello")

	x := &SubscribedSignal{} // pointer b/c can't be copied after first use
	wg := &sync.WaitGroup{}
	ready := &sync.WaitGroup{}

	// unit1
	wg.Add(1)
	ready.Add(1)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		ch, ack := x.Subscribe()
		ready.Done()
		select {
		case <-ch:
			fmt.Println("got signal")
		}
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // wait a bit for fun
		fmt.Println("(1) sending ack...")
		ack() // must call ack
		fmt.Println("done sending ack")
	}()

	// unit2
	wg.Add(1)
	ready.Add(1)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		ch, ack := x.Subscribe()
		ready.Done()
		select {
		case <-ch:
			fmt.Println("got signal")
		}
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) // wait a bit for fun
		fmt.Println("(2) sending ack...")
		ack() // must call ack
		fmt.Println("done sending ack")
	}()

	// unit3
	wg.Add(1)
	ready.Add(1)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		ch, ack := x.Subscribe()
		ready.Done()
		select {
		case <-ch:
			fmt.Println("got signal")
		}
		time.Sleep(3 * time.Second) // wait a bit for fun
		fmt.Println("(3) sending ack...")
		ack() // must call ack
		fmt.Println("done sending ack")
	}()

	ready.Wait() // wait for all subscribes
	fmt.Println("sending signal...")
	x.Send() // trigger!
	fmt.Println("done sending signal")

	wg.Wait() // wait for everyone to exit
	fmt.Println("exiting...")

	// Output: hello
	// sending signal...
	// got signal
	// got signal
	// got signal
	// (1) sending ack...
	// (2) sending ack...
	// (3) sending ack...
	// done sending signal
	// done sending ack
	// done sending ack
	// done sending ack
	// exiting...
}
```

Hope you enjoyed this. Leave me a comment if you build your own synchronization
primitive.

Happy Hacking,
