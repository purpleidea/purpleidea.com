Transportation is very important to me. My whole life I've never owned a car. I
have gotten by with biking, public transit, and various car sharing services.
Sadly, biking is incredibly dangerous and stressful, because most cars don't
respect bicycles, and in the winter it's not very practical, the
[STM](https://www.stm.info/en) (public transit) offers an incredibly unreliable
and unpleasant service, and [Car2Go](https://www.car2go.com/) (car sharing) now
requires that you use their proprietary smart phone app (you used to be able to
just swipe the membership card) so I finally gave up and decided to buy a used
car.

I ended up buying a used, manual, 2013 Honda Civic EX. It has a USB port, so
let's get this thing playing some [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music)!

{{< blog-paragraph-header "First attempts" >}}

I put a bunch of songs on a USB key and plugged it in. Various failures occured...

(I had some images, but I seem to have lost them...)

Each attempt was a trip back to the car with a newly setup USB key. I eventually
brought my laptop into the car, and started iterating from the simplest possible
setup. I couldn't find any clear answers online, so I decided to document my
progress. The internets agreed:

{{< blog-image src="poll.png" caption="I didn't even cheat on the percentages!" scale="100%" >}}

Here's what I found that works:

{{< blog-paragraph-header "The filesystem" >}}

I formatted it with the CLI:

```bash
sudo mkfs.fat -n CAR /dev/sdx
```

Note that I specified a *SHORT* label name in *CAPS*, used `mkfs.fat` (not
`mkfs.exfat`) and used `/dev/sdb`, not `/dev/sdb1`. You'll want to substitute
the device name of your USB key. Look for it with `dmesg --follow`.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "The files" >}}

It seems that longer files names with mixed case worked just fine. If in doubt,
just name your files `ABCDEFGH.MP3`.

You will want to avoid non-mp3 files. You can find them with:

```bash
find . -type f -not -iname '*.mp3'
```

I found that `.m4a` seemed to work as well, whereas `.flac` and `.ogg` did not.
It didn't hurt to have those files present, they just didn't show up.

To convert any of your existing files to `mp3`, you can use:

```bash
for i in *; do ffmpeg -i "$i" "${i%.*}.mp3"; done
```

You can have files in the root directory or even within nested subfolders. I got
about three folders deep, but I'm sure even deeper would work, to a point.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Sorting and play order" >}}

I got it all working, but I noticed that my songs were out of order. You really
don't want the opening track on [2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_(Dr._Dre_album)#Track_listing)
playing in the middle of the album. It turns out that the car doesn't respect
either `.m3u` playlist files, or alphabetical ordering. It actually plays files
in the order they're stored in on the filesystem!

Thankfully, some wonderful hackers have already solved this problem. There's a
tool called `fatsort` (that's even packaged in Fedora) which will take an
existing filesystem, and re-order it so that the files are stored in the
ordering that you want. I used "natural order" sorting. You can run it with:

```bash
sudo fatsort -n /dev/sdb1	# or check the order with -l
```

My notes specified `/dev/sdb1`, not `/dev/sdb`. In case this doesn't work, you
can experiment with the other one. As usual, pick the actual device you're
using.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Why didn't I buy an electric car?" >}}

Very simple!

1. No place to charge. I don't own a home, and I don't have a dedicated parking
spot, so I don't have a good place to charge it. There are public chargers in my
city, but you can only park in them for up to four hours, so it ends up being a
nuisance.

2. Privacy. Most of them are giant piles of garbage software that you can't
control or audit, and which are constantly reporting back to the manufacturer.
This is a dystopian nightmare. Maybe climate change will get us first.

3. Cost. They're incredibly expensive. Hopefully this will get better over time.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Conclusion" >}}

Cars are becoming more like smartphones, and as a result we're getting stuck
with a bunch of proprietary spyware, which hurts all of the users. Hopefully we
can come together as consumers and mandate that safety critical devices like
cars, airplanes, and pacemakers be required to open source their code. Until
then, I'll be listening to my old-school hip-hop when I'm on the road.

Happy Hacking,

James
