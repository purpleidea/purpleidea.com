{{< blog-paragraph-header "Background" >}}

Two years ago, [I left my job at Red Hat](/blog/2018/04/04/leaving-redhat/) to
work on [mgmt config](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/) full-time. I'm still
passionate about this project, and I'm proud of the progress that has been made
in the last two years, but it's time for me to explore new opportunities as
well. My years of experience building mgmt has taught me a lot about open
source, golang and mentoring others, and I hope this makes me a valuable
addition to your team.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "About Me" >}}

If it's your first time here, hi, I'm James. I'm a [McGill University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGill_University)
educated [physiologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology) who has been
working with computers since a very young age. I like working on challenging and
important projects, and I am passionate about research, open source and giving
back. On the internet, I'm usually known as *purpleidea*.
[[1]](https://twitter.com/purpleidea), [[2]](https://github.com/purpleidea/), [[3]](https://purpleidea.com/)

I've worked as a sysadmin, software engineer, config management architect, and
in the devops community. I've worked both full-time, and as a freelancer. I've
worked both on software as well as physical infrastructure and networking. I've
also been involved in copyright/IP law, mostly around open source licensing.
I've worked for big tech, and also for a medical (MRI brain imaging) company.
I've given a large number of talks and tutorials all around the world. A list
with both recordings and ratings is available [here](https://purpleidea.com/talks/).

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Projects" >}}

Here are a few projects that I've worked on recently.

1. [Mgmt Config](/projects/mgmt-config/)
<br>Mgmt is a real-time, event-driven, automation tool that is written in
golang. I am the founder and primary developer on the project. It has over
[*2k* GitHub stars](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/), and over *75* unique
contributors.

2. [DevOps/SWE Mentoring Program](/projects/mentoring-program/)
<br>I run a small non-profit mentoring program that helps interested
participants to improve their sysadmin and software engineering skills. You can
read their [testimonials](/projects/mentoring-program/#testimonials).

3. [Les Garderies K.I.D.S. Infrastructure](/projects/les-garderies-kids/)
<br>Les Garderies K.I.D.S. is a chain of daycares in the Montreal region. I
installed new structured cabling and networking that includes Linux-based
routing, firewalling, dhcp, and managed wifi networks. Their flagship location
has a brand-new Asterisk PBX which I setup and integrated with an RFID door
access system. Both PoE and wireless phones are connected. It also has a camera
system with custom viewing screens that I built from *Raspberry Pi* computers.
You can read their [testimonials](/projects/les-garderies-kids/#testimonials).
