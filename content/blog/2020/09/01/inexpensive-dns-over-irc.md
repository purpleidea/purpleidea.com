The one thing that I've been using for longer than `ssh` is dynamic dns. In this
article I'll explain how I built an inexpensive, reliable, private alternative
to the mainstream tools commonly available today using only golang and [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat).

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Background" >}}

I've had an account with `dyndns.org` for a long time. They used to be free, but
then they cut off the free tier, but left existing accounts alone, until they
eventually cut all the non-payers off entirely. I think we need an inexpensive
way of giving up-and-coming GNU+Linux hackers a way to `ssh` home, and run their
[irssi sessions](https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/10/18/desktop-notifications-for-irssi-in-screen-through-ssh-in-gnome-terminal/),
without having to pay. I also wanted something reliable that wouldn't disappear
the way dyndns did.

I don't need to broadcast the changing IP on the public DNS infrastructure. For
that, there is `ddclient`. However, I've found that it's incredibly unreliable,
and when it fails, I'd like to still be able to find that machine so that I or
[`mgmt`](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/) can connect to it and fix it.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "The design" >}}

I realized that I would need a "third-party" to relay the messages. I'd like
that to be something inexpensive that will be around in another 30 years.
The only thing that came to mind was IRC! I've been using [Libera.chat](https://libera.chat/)
for many years as a way to exchange quality information with other hackers, and
I hope it remains available. I decided to use them as my relay. In the horrible
chance that they ever disappear, I could easily migrate to a different IRC
server since the protocol is open.

Each "server" which you deploy and setup runs a small systemd service. That
service then connects to the IRC server and sits there listening. If a "client"
user connects to the channel and sends a "ping" message, then all the listening
servers respond with a "pong" message that includes their desired hostname and
associated IP address. That client then adds those messages to a local cache to
be used for the host resolution that we require!

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Code" >}}

[The code is available right here.](https://github.com/purpleidea/ircdns)

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Usage" >}}

After downloading the code and the dependencies, you simply:

```bash
make
sudo make install
sudo systemctl start ircdns
```

and your service is happily chugging away! Do this on as many machines as you
manage. I do this on all of the servers and desktops that I manage.

To setup the client on your laptop, you simply:

```bash
make client
sudo make client_install
```

You'll then need to add `ircdns` to the `hosts` line in `/etc/nsswitch.conf`.
You should add the entry before the other network backends like `dns` or `mdns`
to ensure faster resolution. I haven't found a simple, elegant, robust way to
automate this step, but feel free to send a patch if you'd like to.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Testing" >}}

Pretty simple to test, it's all automatic!

```bash
$ ping -c 1 -W 1 example.com.ircdns
PING example.com.ircdns (192.0.2.13) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- example.com.ircdns ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 0ms
```

I personally like adding it to my `~/.ssh/config` so that I can do even more
magic with *SSH*. For example:

```make
Host example
	Hostname example.ircdns
	User root
	LocalForward 1443 192.0.2.42:443
	DynamicForward 1080
```

So that I can `ssh example` with ease! Note that you'll want to use the
`.ircdns` suffix to explicitly request hostnames through this IRC service. This
allows regular dns lookups to not get slowed down by the higher latency
IRC-based lookups.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Classic Mode and Logs" >}}

Since everything is happening over IRC, we can actually interact with this
manually. This is useful for debugging, and for situations where you just want a
single lookup without installing the client code.

{{< blog-image src="irssi.png" caption="view from inside of my IRC client" scale="100%" >}}

In the above session, you can see that I joined the magic IRC channel and listed
the users with `/names`. Then, I sent a `ping` message and saw the responses.
Lastly, I ran `/lastlog hostname4` to get a recent history from anything
matching that pattern. This gives me a useful log of the current and previous IP
addresses for that hostname!

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Internals" >}}

How does this magic work? On the server-side, it's fairly easy. I wrote a small
IRC bot. I did it very quickly, and there's nothing particularly exciting there.
On the client-side it's more interesting! Your `libc` has this incredibly old
thing called the [name service switch](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Name-Service-Switch.html),
and everything basically plugs into that when there's name resolution to do.

(Astute readers might notice that I've conflated "DNS" with "name resolution",
but it's not accidental and is mostly to keep things easy to understand for
others.)

The "name resolution" happens according to the `hosts` line in `/etc/nsswitch.conf`.
Mine now looks like this:

```bash
$ grep '^hosts:' /etc/nsswitch.conf
hosts:	files ircdns dns myhostname
```

Anytime glibc does name resolution, it checks that line, and then runs all the
various plugins listed there. We now have one more listed. It's clever enough to
be very fast and return right away so as not to block the entire lookup if the
request doesn't end in `.ircdns`. (But this is configurable.)

Building such a plugin in golang required a bit of `import "C"`, but all the
hard trail blazing had already been done by [Leo Antunes](https://twitter.com/costela)
for his [docker-nss](https://github.com/costela/nss-docker) resolver. You just
need to implement the `_nss_*_gethostbyname*_r` functions and build it with
`go build -buildmode=c-shared` and some
[linker flags](https://github.com/purpleidea/ircdns/blob/1bc537ad978a6eba1f479afee54cdf1447b03d6d/Makefile#L143).

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Performance" >}}

With a cold-cache, a lookup takes about 10 seconds. This might seem like a long
time, but it's entirely free. As a result you might want to use caching to keep
the most recently used entries fresh. If your workloads are particularly latency
sensitive, then you could run the client as a `systemd` service to watch for new
messages and to keep the cache warm so that lookups would be almost instant.
This could also spin-up on demand, and shutoff after some calculated period of
time.

There's also an option to immediately return once the first valid result comes
in. This can speed things up a little as well, and is possible because the IRC
client streams the results to be processed in real-time.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Security" >}}

Currently, this is running in my own private IRC channel, and I only use it for
`ssh`, where I already verify host keys before connecting, so security is not a
major priority for me, and I'm not particularly worried about anyone `dos`-ing
my IRC channel.

However, improvements could be made! Each server could have a public and private
key pair, and the public halves could be copied to the client laptop. All their
messages could be signed so that the client could automatically ignore any
unsigned broadcasts. Similarly, the server could have a public and private key
pair, and the public halves could be copied to the server machines. Any "ping"
message that is not signed appropriately could be ignored!

(All signed messages should also include a monotonic timestamp to prevent replay
attacks!)

This project has been built as a standalone golang binary that embeds all of its
configuration. As a result, it would be easy to embed and deploy the necessary
key pairs automatically.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Improvements" >}}

Currently we detect the public IP address by polling. I'd like to avoid having
to ping an external server (even though it checks a whole list of them to avoid
SPOF) and I'd also like to avoid polling. If you know of a robust, event-driven
mechanism to replace this, please let me know!

As discussed, improved caching could be a huge benefit if your use-case requires
it. More robust cryptographic security could also be added, again, if your
use-case requires it. Lastly, an [mgmt config](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/)
module to automatically deploy this would be useful. If you'd like to work on,
or [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/purpleidea/) any or all of these,
please [contact me](https://purpleidea.com/contact/) and let me know.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Custom configuration" >}}

A lot of custom configuration can be changed for your own personalized `ircdns`
builds. I haven't fully documented or implemented that, since it's outside the
scope of what I needed for my use-case. It currently connects to the #ircdns
channel on [Libera.chat](https://libera.chat/), but that can be changed. If
you'd like some custom builds and a hand setting this up, please let me know! I
will offer this service for an extremely low price matched to meet your budget.
If you write [open source](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) software
that I use, then I will probably do it for free.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Conclusion" >}}

1. Reliable, long-term name resolution relay via IRC protocol. This depends on
[Libera.chat](https://libera.chat/) existing, so please send them a few dollars.

2. Natively integrated with the venerable *name service switch* so lookups work
with your existing tools.

3. Free.

I hope you enjoyed this and found it useful.

Happy Hacking,

James
