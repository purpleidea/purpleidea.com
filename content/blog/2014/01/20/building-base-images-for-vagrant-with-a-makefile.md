I needed a base image "<a href="https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes.html">box</a>" for my <a title="Automatically deploying GlusterFS with Puppet-Gluster + Vagrant!" href="/blog/automatically-deploying-glusterfs-with-puppet-gluster-vagrant/">Puppet-Gluster+Vagrant</a> work. It would have been great if good boxes already existed, and even better if it were easy to build my own. As it turns out, I wasn't able to satisfy either of these conditions, so I've had to build one myself! <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-gluster/blob/master/builder/README">I've published all of my code</a>, so that you can use these techniques and <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-gluster/blob/master/builder/Makefile">tools</a> too!

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Status quo</span>:</strong>

Having an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here">NIH problem</a> is bad for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants">your vision</a>, and it's best to benefit from existing tools before creating your own. I first tried using <em><a href="https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-cachier">vagrant-cachier</a></em>, and then <em><a href="https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee">veewee</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/packer">packer</a></em>. <em>Vagrant-cachier</em> is a great tool, but it turned out not being very useful because there weren't any base images available for download that met my needs. <em>Veewee</em> and <em>packer</em> can build those images, but they both failed in doing so for different reasons. Hopefully this situation will improve in the future.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Writing a script</span>:</strong>

I started by hacking together a short <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html">shell script</a> of commands for building base images. There wasn't much programming involved as the process was fairly linear, but it was useful to figure out what needed getting done.

I decided to use the excellent <a href="http://libguestfs.org/virt-builder.1.html"><code>virt-builder</code></a> command to put together the base image. This is exactly what it's good at doing! To install it on Fedora 20, you can run:
```
$ sudo yum install libguestfs-tools
```
It wasn't available in Fedora 19, but after a lot of pain, I managed to build (mostly correct?) packages. I have <a href="https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/purpleidea/virt-builder/f19/rpm/">posted them online</a> if you are <a href="https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/purpleidea/virt-builder/f19/rpm/README">brave (or crazy?)</a> enough to want them.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Using the right tool</span>:</strong>

After building a few images, I realized that a shell script was the wrong tool, and that it was time for an upgrade. What was the right tool? <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html"><em>GNU Make</em></a>! After working on this for more hours than I'm ready to admit, I present to you, a lovingly crafted virtual machine base image ("box") builder:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-gluster/blob/master/builder/Makefile">Makefile</a></blockquote>
The <code>Makefile</code> itself is quite compact. It uses a few shell scripts to do some of the customization, and builds a clean image in about <em>ten</em> minutes. To use it, just run <code>make</code>.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Customization</span>:</strong>

At the moment, it builds <em>x86_64</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS">CentOS</a> 6.5+ machines for <a href="https://github.com/pradels/vagrant-libvirt/">vagrant-libvirt</a>, but you can edit the <code>Makefile</code> to build a custom image of your choosing. I've gone out of my way to add an <code>$(OUTPUT)</code> variable to the <code>Makefile</code> so that your generated files get saved in <code>/tmp/</code> or somewhere outside of your source tree.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Download the image</span>:</strong>

If you'd like to download the image that I generated, it is being generously hosted by the <a href="https://www.gluster.org/">Gluster</a> community <a href="https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/purpleidea/vagrant/">here</a>. If you're using the <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-gluster/blob/master/vagrant/gluster/Vagrantfile">Vagrantfile</a> from my <a title="Automatically deploying GlusterFS with Puppet-Gluster + Vagrant!" href="/blog/2014/01/08/automatically-deploying-glusterfs-with-puppet-gluster-vagrant/">Puppet-Gluster+Vagrant</a> setup, then you don't have to download it manually, this will happen automatically.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Open issues</span>:</strong>

The biggest issue with the images is that <em>SELinux</em> gets disabled! You might be okay with this, but it's actually quite unfortunate. It is disabled to avoid the <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-gluster/blob/master/builder/Makefile#L57"><em>SELinux</em> relabelling</a> that happens on first boot, as this overhead defeats the usefulness of a fast vagrant deployment. If you know of a way to fix this problem, please let me know!

Happy hacking,

PS: Be careful when writing <code>Makefile</code>'s. They can be dangerous if used improperly, and in fact I once took out part of my <code>lib/</code> directory by running one. Woops!
