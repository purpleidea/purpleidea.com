Master <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Defined_Networking">SDN</a> hacker <a href="https://twitter.com/guteusa">Flavio</a> sent me some tunes. They were sitting on my desktop in a folder:
```
$ ls ~/Desktop/
uncopyrighted_tunes_from_flavio/
```
I wanted to listen them while hacking, but what was the easiest way...? I wanted to use the <em>nautilus</em> file browser to select which folder to play, and the <em>totem</em> music/video player to do the playing.

Drop a file named <code>totem</code> into:
```
~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/
```
with the contents:
```
#!/bin/bash
# o hai from purpleidea
exec totem -- "$@"
```
and make it executable with:
```
$ chmod u+x ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/totem
```
Now right-click on that music folder in <em>nautilus</em>, and you should see a <code>Scripts</code> menu. In it there will be a <code>totem</code> menu item. Clicking on it should load up all the contents in <em>totem</em> and you'll be rocking out in no time. You can also run scripts with a selection of various files.

Here's a screenshot:

<table style="text-align:center; width:80%; margin:0 auto;"><tr><td><a href="nautilus-scripts-folder.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-846" src="nautilus-scripts-folder.png" alt="nautilus is pretty smart and lets you know that this folder is special" width="100%" height="100%" /></a></td></tr><tr><td> nautilus is pretty smart and even lets you know that this folder is special</td></tr></table></br />

I wrote this to demonstrate a cute <em>nautilus</em> hack. Hopefully you'll use this idea to extend this feature for something even more useful.

Happy hacking,

James
