<em>So this happened</em>:

<table style="text-align:center; width:80%; margin:0 auto;"><tr><td><a href="james-redhat.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-804" src="james-redhat.jpg" alt="James just James at RedHat headquarters in North Carolina" width="100%" height="100%" /></a></td></tr><tr><td> James just James at RedHat headquarters in North Carolina wearing his new red hat.</td></tr></table></br />

<a href="https://www.redhat.com/">RedHat</a> made me an offer, and I am happy to say that I have just started this week!

I am proud to have joined a company that employs many of the worlds foremost, highly professional and clever <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28term%29">hackers</a>. It is indubitably the best <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html">Free Software</a> [1] / <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Open Source</a> company out there, and they ship some of the greatest and most elegant software available.

Happy hacking,

James
