<a href="/blog/">The Technical Blog of James</a> was seen on an outdoor electronic display in downtown Montreal! Thanks to one of my readers for sending this in.

<table style="text-align:center; width:80%; margin:0 auto;"><tr><td><a href="ttboj-downtown.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-1866" src="ttboj-downtown.png" alt="I guess the smart phone revolution is over, and people are taking to reading my articles on bigger screens!" width="100%" height="100%" /></a></td></tr><tr><td> I guess the smart phone revolution is over, and people are taking to reading my articles on bigger screens! The "poutine" is decent proof that this is probably Montreal.</td></tr></table></br />

If you've got access to a large electronic display, put up the blog, snap a photo, and send it my way! I'll post it here and send you some random stickers!

Happy Hacking,

James
