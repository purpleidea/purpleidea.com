I'm thrilled to tell you that I'll be speaking about <a href="/tags/mgmtconfig/">mgmt</a> in Hong Kong and South Africa. It will be my first time to both countries and my first time to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia">Asia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa">Africa</a>!

In Hong Kong I'll be speaking at <a href="https://2016.opensource.hk/topics/next-generation-config-mgmt/">HKOSCon2016</a>.

In South Africa I'll be speaking at <a href="https://debconf16.debconf.org/schedule/">DebConf16</a>.

I'm looking forward to meeting with many of the hard-working Debian hackers, and collaborating with them to build and promote excellent Free Software. The <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/">mgmt</a> project considers both Fedora and Debian to be first class platforms, and parity is a primary design goal.

I'll be presenting and demoing many of the new features in mgmt. If you haven't heard about the project, <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/#on-the-web">please read some of the posts about it...</a>

You're also welcome to come join our IRC channel! It's <a href="https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#mgmtconfig">#mgmtconfig</a> on Libera.chat.

Many special thanks to both conference organizers as well as <a href="https://redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> and the <a href="https://community.redhat.com/">OSAS</a> department for sponsoring my travel! Without it, visiting these places and interacting with new continents of hackers would be impossible.

Happy Hacking,

James
