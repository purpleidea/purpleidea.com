On today's issue of "one hour hacks", I'll show you how you can stop your git drive-by's to git master from breaking your CI tests... Let's continue!

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The problem</span>:</strong>

Sometimes I've got a shitty one-line patch that I want to push to <code>git master</code>. I'm usually right, and everything tests out fine, but usually isn't always, and then I look silly while I frantically try to fix <code>git master</code> on a <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/">project that I maintain</a>. Let's use tools to hide our human flaws!

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">How you're really supposed to do it</span>:</strong>

Good hackers know that you're supposed to:
<ul>
	<li>checkout a new feature branch for your patch
<ul>
	<li><code>checkout -b feat/foo</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>write the patch and commit it
<ul>
	<li><code>git add -p && git commit -m 'my foo'</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>push that branch up to origin
<ul>
	<li><code>git push origin feat/foo</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>wait for the tests to succeed
<ul>
	<li><code>hub ci-status && sleep 1m && ...</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>merge and push to git master
<ul>
	<li><code>git checkout master && git merge feat/foo && git push</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>delete your local branch
<ul>
	<li><code>git branch -d feat/foo</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>delete the remote branch
<ul>
	<li><code>git push origin :feat/foo</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>mourn all the lost time it took to push this patch
<ul>
	<li><code>cat && drink && sleep 8h</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
If it happens to fail, you have to remember what the safe <code>git reset</code> command is, and then you have to start all over!

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">How do we make this easy</span>?</strong>

<a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/">I write tools</a>, so I sat down and wrote a cheap little bash script to do it for me! Sharing is caring, so please enjoy a copy!

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">How does it work</span>?</strong>

It actually just does all of the above for you automatically, and it automatically cleans up all of the temporary branches when it's done! Here are two example runs to help show you the tool in action:

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">A failure scenario</span>:</strong>

Here I add a patch with some trailing whitespace, which will easily get caught by the automatic test suite. You'll note that I actually had to force the commit locally with <code>git commit -n</code>, because the <code>pre-commit</code> hook actually caught this first. You could extend this script to run your test suite locally before you push the patch, but that defeats the idea of a drive-by.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">A successful scenario</span>:</strong>

In this example, I amended the previous patch in my local copy of <code>git master</code> (which never got pushed to the public git master!) and then I ran <code>git tpush</code> again.

Please take note of the "Waiting for CI..." text. This is actually a spinner which updates itself. Run this tool yourself to get the full effect! This avoids having 200 line scrollback in your terminal while you wait for your CI to complete.

Lastly, you'll note that I run <code>git tpush</code> instead of <code>git-tpush</code>. This is because I added an alias to my ~/.gitconfig. It's quite easy, just add:
```
tpush = !git-tpush
```
under the <code>[alias]</code> section, and ensure the <code>git-tpush</code> shell script is in your <code>~/bin/</code> folder and is executable.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Pre-requisites</span>:</strong>

This actually depends on the <a href="https://github.com/github/hub">hub</a> command line tool which knows how to ask our CI about the test status. It sucks using a distributed tool like git with a centralized thing like github, but it's still pretty easy for me to move away if they go bad. You'll also want the <code>tput</code> installed if you want the fancy spinner, but that comes with most GNU/Linux distros by default.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The code</span>:</strong>

PS: No, I couldn't think of a better name than git-tpush, if you don't like it feel free to rename it yourself!
