{{< blog-paragraph-header "mgmt @ FOSDEM" >}}

Later today I'm giving four talks about [mgmt](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt)
at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/speaker/james_shubin/). I'm also
giving two more on the following day. (One is a 5 min lightning talk.) I don't
know how I got accepted for so many talks, I just replied to the CFP for every
room where I thought I had something interesting to share, and well, here we
are!

I got rejected for the main track again, but I guess it's up to me to make my
work more generally appealing first.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "mgmt @ CfgMgmtCamp" >}}

On the 4th, I'll be giving two talks at [CfgMgmtCamp](https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/speaker/jamesshubin/),
which immediately follows FOSDEM. On the last day of the event, there will be a
[mgmt hackathon](https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/fringes/mgmtconfighackathon/), which is
also free to attend.

I'll be giving out stickers if you find me or come to a talk!

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Hacking around the world" >}}

After all that winds down, I'll be hanging out in Antwerp, Belgium for two weeks
to hack on mgmt and eat local cuisine. Feel free to [contact](/contact/) me if
you're in the area and would like to hack.

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Sponsored hacking" >}}

Right afterwards the folks at [Normation](http://normation.com/) who work on
[Rudder](https://www.rudder.io/en/) and sponsoring my expenses for a three day
hackathon in Paris. Their offices are there, and I'm looking forward to helping
them use mgmt!

If you or your company would like to do something similar, please [let me know](/contact/).

{{< blog-paragraph-header "New features!" >}}

There's lots of new stuff in mgmt. We even made a new release recently, and you
can download pre-built binaries!

```shell
$ mgmt --version
<download mgmt to find out!> ;)
```

{{< blog-paragraph-header "Conclusion" >}}

I hope you help contribute! It's not easy self-funding such a project of my
savings, so every [patch](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt) or [donation](https://www.patreon.com/purpleidea)
helps!

Happy Hacking,

James
