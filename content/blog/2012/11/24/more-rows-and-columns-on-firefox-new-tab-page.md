<a href="http://firefox.com/">Firefox</a> has a "new tab" <em>speed dial</em> type page available. I use it as my homepage (hint, use: about:newtab) and find it very useful for launching my often used favourites.

My one gripe is that it only shows you a default grid of 3 x 3. You can easily change that if you look in the secret preferences. Open a new tab and type in: <em>about:config</em>, accept the warning, and then search for: <em>browser.newtabpage.rows</em> and <em>browser.newtabpage.columns</em>. These values are easily editable by double clicking on the row. (Bold indicates non defaults.)

I chose a rectangular (column) size of 4, and now I've got just enough favourites to suit my frequent browsing habits.

Happy hacking,

James

PS: Now if firefox would only integrate natively with gnome-keyring like chrome and <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/epiphany/">epiphany</a> already do!
