Hello <a href="http://www.planetpuppet.org/">planet puppet</a> readers!

<a href="http://www.masterzen.fr/">Brice Figureau</a>[1] who runs <a href="http://www.planetpuppet.org/">planet puppet</a> has just syndicated my blog, so thanks go out to him.

To all readers, I hope you enjoy my content, and please don't be shy to comment and let me know if there are particular subjects or posts that I should elaborate on. I've got a whack of technical posts in the archives, so feel free to browse and let me know what's good!

Only my puppet related posts should appear on planet puppet, so if you're interested in <a href="/blog/">other linux/sysadmin/technical posts, feel free to drop by.</a>

Happy hacking,

James
