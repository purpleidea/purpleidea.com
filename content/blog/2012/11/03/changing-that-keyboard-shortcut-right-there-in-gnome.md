I love my keyboard shortcuts, and I sometimes I want to change them. If you're ever in a gnome application and wanted to change *that one right there*, you can now live-edit them!

In a terminal, first enable this feature:
```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface can-change-accels true
```
Next, hover over the menu item shortcut that you want to change. Enter the shortcut you want. It should update immediately! I like to disable this live-editing, so that I don't accidentally change any shortcuts. To do so run:
```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface can-change-accels false
```
Too bad firefox doesn't support this. This is one more reason why native GTK apps make your entire experience blend together (consistent) and more magic!

Happy hacking!

PS: If you're curious, I used this to change the gnome-terminal and gedit cycle tab left/right actions to instead respond to the thinkpad back/forward keys which are conveniently located right above the left and right arrow keys respectively.
