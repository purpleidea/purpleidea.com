Dear internets,

During my daily grind of computer architecturing, I often learn something new that I wish a mentor had taught me earlier. I will post my babbles here, so that the interested might learn, and for the wiser to comment on.

Happy Hacking!

James

PS: I had a previous blog, but that server was taken down. It has been merged into this one!
