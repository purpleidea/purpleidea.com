Many thanks to johnmark in #gluster for syndicating my "gluster" tagged blog posts on <a href="http://www.gluster.org/blog/">http://www.gluster.org/blog/</a>

I aim to keep these posts technical and informative, aimed mostly at other sysadmins and gluster users. Please don't  be shy to comment on my writing style or to let me know if you need more information about a particular subject. If you have any ideas about things you'd like me to write about, let me know and I'll try to do my best. I like feedback!

Happy hacking,
James

PS: My main <a href="/blog/">blog</a> will still contain other technical articles not relating to gluster, should that be useful to you.
