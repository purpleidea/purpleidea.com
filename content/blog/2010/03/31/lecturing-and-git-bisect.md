I was recently asked to give a lecture for the <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prelude/Prelude/Home.html">PRELUDE</a> series at McGill. Here was my abstract:
<blockquote>
<blockquote>I don't like computers, and neither should you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We spend too much time figuring out how to talk to them, instead of having them figure out how to understand us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>There's a big discontinuity between what software is providing, and the killer features we want!</blockquote>
<blockquote>We're not completely lost though. There are a lot of good tools and methodologies available!</blockquote>
<blockquote>Until the feature gap closes, let me introduce you to some of these tools, and show you how I use the computer.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<span style="background-color:#ffffff;">I spoke about a variety of topics with the intention of filling in everyone's knowledge about the useful tools available to users and developers. I included a section about <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-bisect.html">git-bisect</a> and have posted the script in the examples section of the <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~james/code/">bash-tutor</a> tarball. It is now available for you to download and share.</span>

<span style="background-color:#ffffff;">I hope everyone enjoyed the lecture, and I always appreciate feedback!</span>
