i decided i'd compile a short list of features / functionality which should be added to the new <a href="http://maemo.nokia.com/n900/">nokia N900</a> to make it totally pro. it's pretty good as it is, despite it not working with the <a href="http://www.bell.ca/">bell</a> networks. i've attempted to order this list in order of importance (more or less).
<ul>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">all the closed source bits must become free software under a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a> or <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">AGPL</a> license.</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">it should support a fully encrypted file system. if i lose my phone, i shouldn't worry that all my data or contacts get stolen!</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">addresses that are stored in contacts should integrate with maps program. (currently they only display)</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">the stock maps tool should integrate nicely with the rest of the phone. currently it's a bit of a sore thumb. confusing too. also it's green.</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">screen/interfaces should support multi touch.</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">user should be able to choose username instead of default "user"</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">hostname should match bluetooth name, etc... on device, one name.</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">it should support the "usb on the go" host functionality. i'd like to be able to plug in a usb key and be able to copy files to and from it.</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">better battery, if even only an upgrade to the 1500mAh version.</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">once plugged in via usb, it would be nice to be able to unmount as usb device while retaining the charging functionality. currently, when you click on the notification area thing, usb mass storage mode is connected, but there is no software way to disconnect. (that i know of) this is important because you can't access the files through your phone when mounted.</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">user should be able to specify which accounts notify you of new messages and which don't. same for which do periodic updates and when.</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">default shell should be bash, not busybox, and it should include usual software like "man".</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">should include stock ir remote control software, that has a large database of hardware including radios, air conditioners and weird tvs. irreco needs some serious work.</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">people sometimes click on contacts to view data eg a phone number or address to use on a different phone or otherwise. it should be easy to zoom into to read.</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">my gps should just work. (it doesn't seem to at the moment for some reason)</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">since i change my wireless WEP keys often, and always forget them, the phones wireless manager should integrate nicely with aircrack-ng to easily help me recover my lost WEP key.</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">it could be a little thinner. it's a bit of a brick as it stands. i could overlook this problem if it did everything above.</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">battery life indicator could benefit from having a countdown timer (sure it would change based on usage, but it would give users an approximate idea)</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">the cameras should be able to function as a usb camera for the computer when the device is plugged in. (over bluetooth could be nice too)</span></li>
</ul>
unfortunately i haven't mentioned this phones positive features-- many before me have-- there are many! overall it's a nice package and i look forward to seeing improvements to the above.
