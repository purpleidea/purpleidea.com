if i've been silent as of late, it's because i've been furiously coding away. i've got what i think are some elegant implementations cooking, and with any luck my extra work will pay off in hours and days and months of time saved down the road. i've got a few interesting (interesting with respect to your average rating of the blog posts on this site) posts cooking in my mind, and hopefully they'll appear shortly!

in other news, i'd like to reference an already pretty well referenced, but probably less read link, explaining the confusion you've no doubt once had to suffer through (or still do)
