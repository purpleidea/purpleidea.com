Making <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/oh-my-vagrant">Oh-My-Vagrant</a> (OMV) more developer accessible and easy to install (from a distribution package like RPM) has always been a goal, but was previously never a priority. This is all sorted out now. In this article, I'll explain how "mainstream" mode works, and how the RPM work was done. (I promise this will be somewhat interesting!)

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Prerequisites</span>:</strong>

If you haven't read any of the <a href="/tags/oh-my-vagrant/">previous articles about Oh-My-Vagrant</a>, I'd recommend you start there. Many of the articles include screencasts, and combined with the <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/oh-my-vagrant/tree/master/examples">examples/</a> folder, this is probably the best way to learn OMV, because the <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/oh-my-vagrant/issues/79">documentation could use some love</a>.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Installation</span>:</strong>

OMV is now easily installable on Fedora 22 via COPR. It probably works on other distros and versions, but I haven't tested all of those combinations. This is a colossal improvement from when I <a href="/blog/2013/12/09/vagrant-on-fedora-with-libvirt/" target="_blank">first posted about this publicly in 2013</a>. There is still <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1221304" target="_blank">one annoying bug</a> that I occasionally hit. Let me know if you can reproduce.

Install from COPR:
```
james@computer:~$ sudo dnf copr enable purpleidea/oh-my-vagrant

If you'd like to avoid typing passwords over and over again when using vagrant, you can add yourself into the vagrant group. 99% of people do this. The downside is that it could allow your user account to get root privileges. Since most developers have a single user environment, it's not a big issue. This is necessary because vagrant uses the <code>qemu:///system</code> connection instead of <code>qemu:///session</code>. If you can help fix this, <a href="https://github.com/pradels/vagrant-libvirt/issues/272">please hack on it</a>.
```
james@computer:~$ groups
james wheel docker
james@computer:~$ sudo usermod -aG vagrant james
# you'll need to logout/login for this change to take effect...
```
Lastly, there is a user session plugin addition that is required. Installation is automatic the first time you create a new OMV project. Let's do that and see how it works!
```
james@computer:~$ mkdir /tmp/omvtest
james@computer:~$ cd !$
cd /tmp/omvtest
james@computer:/tmp/omvtest$ which omv
/usr/bin/omv
james@computer:/tmp/omvtest$ omv init

You can see that the plugin installation worked perfectly, and that OMV created a few files and folders.

As you can see all the mess is wrapped up in a single folder. This could even be named <code>.omv</code> if you prefer, and should all be committed inside of your project. Now that we're installed, let's get hacking!

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Mainstream mode</span>:</strong>

Mainstream mode further hides the ruby/<code>Vagrantfile</code> aspect of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrant_%28software%29">Vagrant</a> project and extends OMV so that you can define your entire project via the <code>omv.yaml</code> file, without the rest of the OMV project cluttering up your development tree. This makes it possible to have your project use OMV by only committing that one <em>yaml</em> file into the project repo.

The main difference is that you now control everything with the new <code>omv</code> command line tool. It's essentially a smart wrapper around the <code>vagrant</code> command, so any command you used to use <code>vagrant</code> for, you can now substitute in <code>omv</code>. It also saves typing four extra characters!

As it turns out (and by no accident) the <code>omv</code> tool works exactly like the <code>vagrant</code> tool. For example:
```
james@computer:/tmp/omvtest2$ omv status
Current machine states:

omv1                      not created (libvirt)

The Libvirt domain is not created. Run `vagrant up` to create it.
james@computer:/tmp/omvtest2$ omv up

==> omv1: Domain is not created. Please run `vagrant up` first.

```
<em>BUT THAT'S NOT ALL...</em>

The existing tools you know and love, like <code>vlog</code>, <a href="/blog/2013/12/21/vagrant-vsftp-and-other-tricks/"><code>vsftp</code></a>, <code>vscreen</code>, <a href="/blog/2014/01/02/vagrant-clustered-ssh-and-screen/"><code>vcssh</code></a>, <code>vfwd</code>, <code>vansible</code>, have all been modified to work with OMV mainstream mode as well. The same goes for common aliases such as <code>vs</code>, <code>vp</code>, <code>vup</code>, <code>vdestroy</code>, <code>vrsync</code>, and the useful (but occasionally dangerous) <code>vrm-rf</code>. Have a look at the above links on my blog and <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/oh-my-vagrant/blob/master/extras/vagrant.bashrc">the source</a> to see what these do. If it's not clear enough, <a href="#comment">let me know</a>!

All of these are now packaged up in the <em>oh-my-vagrant</em> COPR and are installed automatically into <code>/etc/profile.d/oh-my-vagrant.sh</code> for your convenience. Since they're part of the OMV project, you'll get updates when new functions or bug fixes are made.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The plumbing</span>:</strong>

Mainstream mode is possible because of an idea <a href="https://github.com/rbarlow">rbarlow</a> had. He gets full credit for the idea, in particular for teaching me about <code>VAGRANT_CWD</code> which is what makes it all work. I <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/oh-my-vagrant/pull/89">rejected his 6 line prototype</a>, but loved the idea, and since he was busy making <a href="http://www.pulpproject.org/">juice</a>, I got bored one day and hacked on a <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/oh-my-vagrant/commit/aa764ae79d69475b87f293c43af4f20fd7d1d000">full implementation</a>.

It turned out it was a little longer, but I artificially inflated this by including some quick doc patches. What does it actually do differently? It sets <code>VAGRANT_CWD</code> and <code>VAGRANT_DOTFILE_PATH</code> so that the vagrant command looks in a different directory for the <code>Vagrantfile</code> and <code>.vagrant/</code> directories. That way, all the plumbing is hidden and part of the RPM.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Making the RPM</span>:</strong>

The RPM's happened because <a href="https://github.com/stefwalter">stefw</a> made me feel bad about not having them. He was right to do so. In an case, RPM packaging still scares me. I think <a href="https://www.xkcd.com/1205/">repetitive work</a> scares me even more. That's why I <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">automate</a> as much as I can. So <a href="https://twitter.com/purpleidea/status/618167815388794881" target="_blank">after a lot of brain loss</a>, I finally made you an RPM so that you could easily install it. Here's how it went:

<a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/oh-my-vagrant/commit/8ee3fdab7451bb30b56e42c4586e4304b5805faf">I started by adding the magic so that my Makefile could build an RPM</a>.

This made it so I can easily run <code>make srpm</code> to get a new RPM or SRPM.

<a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/oh-my-vagrant/commit/6a6d1f2be89ac0ef932f98368fcf672c7a0d95cc">Then I added COPR integration</a>, so a <code>make copr</code> automatically kicks off a new COPR build. This was the interesting part. You'll need a <a href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/#FAS">Fedora account</a> for this to work. Once you're logged in, if you go to <a href="https://copr.fedoraproject.org/api">https://copr.fedoraproject.org/api</a> you'll be able to download a snippet to put in your <code>~/.config/copr</code> file. Lastly, the work happens in <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/oh-my-vagrant/blob/master/extras/copr-build.py">copr-build.py</a> where the python <em>copr</em> library does the heavy lifting.

There was a bunch of additional fixing and polishing required to get this as seamless as possible for you.
