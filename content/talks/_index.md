What follows is a reverse chronological list of presentations which I’ve given.
I’ve tried to make the list as exhaustive as possible. If I forgot something,
please [contact](/contact/) me! Please note that while some of the presentations
might have similar titles, presentations are always updated with the latest
material and developments.

If you'd like to have me as a speaker at your event, please
[let me know](/contact/)! I can also give these presentations internally for
groups who'd like a private presentation or workshop on the subject matter.

I can give live demos, individual or group tutorials, speak at your conferences,
and do consulting work too. Some of the topics and sessions that I recommend
include:

* Topics that you've read about on my [*Technical Blog*](/blog/)
* Beginner, Intermediate or Advanced *GNU/Linux tutorials*
* *[DevOps](/tags/devops/)* hacks, tricks and other fundamentals
* [*Next Generation Configuration Management*](/tags/mgmtconfig/) presentations
* [*Puppet*](/tags/puppet/), related work, such as [*puppet-gluster*](https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-gluster/) or [*puppet-ipa*](https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-ipa/).
* *Intermediate Cardiology*, for scientists or medical workers (such as paramedics)
* *I.T. infrastructure design and evaluations* (_physical_, eg: data center, [cable management](http://www.reddit.com/r/cableporn) *and* _virtual_, eg: [configuration](/tags/mgmtconfig/), software, network)

Happy hacking!
