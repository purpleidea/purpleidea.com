      <description>I decided to record some screencasts to show how easy it is to deploy GlusterFS using Puppet-Gluster+Vagrant. You can follow along even if you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about Puppet or Vagrant. The hardest part of this process was producing the actual videos!&#xA;If recommend first reading my earlier articles if you&amp;rsquo;re planning on following along:&#xA;Vagrant on Fedora with libvirt Vagrant vsftp and other tricks Vagrant clustered SSH and &#39;screen&#39; Automatically deploying GlusterFS with Puppet-Gluster + Vagrant!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m speaking at LISA 2013, the &amp;ldquo;Large Installation System Administration&amp;rdquo; conference. This conference runs all week in Washington. I&amp;rsquo;ll be giving two talks during the week, and attending at least one BOF.&#xA;My first talk is on Monday during the Gluster Community Day. I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking about puppet-gluster, and giving a live demo. I&amp;rsquo;ll be showing some new features too. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to talk more about puppet-gluster, or want to attend the talk, give me a shout, or sign up at the above Gluster Community Day link.</description>

      <description>John Mark Walker, (from Redhat) has been kind enough to invite me to speak at the Linuxcon Gluster Workshop in New Orleans. I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking about puppet-gluster, giving demos, and hopefully showing off some new features. I&amp;rsquo;m also looking forward to meeting up with gluster expert Joe Julian.&#xA;If there are features that puppet-gluster is missing, or you have a use case that I haven&amp;rsquo;t covered, please let me know, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to work on it for you ahead of the conference.</description>
