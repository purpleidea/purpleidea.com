      <description>Picture this. You&amp;rsquo;ve got a supermicro server. It&amp;rsquo;s got eight hot-swappable 3.5&amp;quot; HDD&amp;rsquo;s. You want to use all of those for storage, so you buy a nifty add-on that let&amp;rsquo;s you add four additional 2.5&amp;quot; SSD&amp;rsquo;s. Those are great for your OS. That&amp;rsquo;s a great way to keep your data separate. The motherboard only supports eight drives, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need an HBA for the additional four&amp;hellip; What are some catches and things you need to watch out for?</description>

      <description>Fedora did a lovely job of updating me to the latest versionÂ (v. 20) of Firefox. One problem I found, was that scrolling on certain pages was quite jerky. Performance was worse (or more likely) on pages with a frameset, and pages which were long. Pages with many images made this problem worse.&#xA;It turns out that the workaround is to disable hardware acceleration:&#xA;After you&amp;rsquo;ve unchecked this box, restart Firefox, and scrolling is now considerably smoother.</description>
