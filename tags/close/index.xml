      <description>After hacking around with a few firefox internals the other day, I decided there was another little annoyance that I had&amp;hellip; When I&amp;rsquo;m acting insane and using my mouse to open and close tabs, the per tab close button disappears when there is only one tab left! This is apparently a feature, and while I can respect it as a default, it certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t an option for me. Thankfully, there are a lot of common minded individuals on the net, and the (hack) solution already existed.</description>
