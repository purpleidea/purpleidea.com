      <description>It was time to take the plunge and upgrade from Fedora 18 to Fedora 19. Fedora 18 was one of the worst releases ever, so I figured it could only get better. I ran my backups as usual, however this time I didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to need them, the upgrade process went off without a hitch! I used the fedup-cli process over the network. I always run these things inside of screen.</description>

      <description>I love GNOME and Fedora, but &amp;ldquo;upgrading&amp;rdquo; from Fedora 17 to 18 did not go well for me. I recommend you wait until either these are all fixed, or Fedora 19+ suits your needs. Here are a list of problems I had, and some workarounds. Hopefully proper patches to these bugs will get merged quickly, so that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to use these fixes.&#xA;Problem: Boot fails after upgrade from Fedora 17 to Fedora 18.</description>
