      <description>The one thing that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for longer than ssh is dynamic dns. In this article I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how I built an inexpensive, reliable, private alternative to the mainstream tools commonly available today using only golang and IRC.&#xA;Background:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve had an account with dyndns.org for a long time. They used to be free, but then they cut off the free tier, but left existing accounts alone, until they eventually cut all the non-payers off entirely.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m old school cool. Real hackers chat on open, distributed platforms. Most technical discussion can be found on the Libera.chat IRC network. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect, but the advantages clearly outweigh the drawbacks.&#xA;Recently, I needed to join an existing large &amp;ldquo;community&amp;rdquo; on the centralized, proprietary walled garden that is the Slack network.&#xA;The Problem:&#xA;Connecting to the the Slack server requires that you use either the proprietary client or their proprietary web app.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m usually on IRC, but I don&amp;rsquo;t often notice incoming pings until after the fact. I had to both write, and modify various scripts to get what I wanted, but now it&amp;rsquo;s all done, and you can benefit from my hacking by following along&amp;hellip;&#xA;The Setup&#xA;Laptop -&amp;gt; Gnome-Terminal -&amp;gt; SSH -&amp;gt; Screen -&amp;gt; Irssi This way, I&amp;rsquo;m connected to IRC, even when my laptop isn&amp;rsquo;t. I run irssi in a screen session on an SSH server that I manage, and I use gnome-terminal on my laptop.</description>
