      <description>Mgmt modules are used for structuring your code across multiple files. This keeps things readable and allows for code reusability. For example, it should be easy to write a single module which can be effectively used by many different parties. To me, it never felt like code reuse was a core design objective with other tools. In mgmt it has been since the very beginning. I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of our module system, so let me introduce you to it properly.</description>

      <title>Mgmt Configuration Language: Functions</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a little while since I introduced the Mgmt Configuration Language. I originally wrote this article in 2019, and as I was working on it alongside the code for functions, when I realized that lambdas didn&amp;rsquo;t work properly. It took some time to finally solve that properly. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been working to get mgmt production ready. It&amp;rsquo;s properly useful for production now, and so it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to catch up on my documentation.</description>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m announcing a new type of provisioning tool. This is both the culmination of a long road, and the start of a new era. Please read on for all of the details. Feel free to skip to the relevant sections you&amp;rsquo;re interested in if you don&amp;rsquo;t want all of the background.&#xA;Ten years:&#xA;The vision for this specific tool started around ten years ago. Previously, as a sysadmin, I spent a lot of my time using a configuration management tool called puppet.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a little over a year since I introduced the Mgmt Configuration Language. A lot has happened since then, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce some of the missing features that weren&amp;rsquo;t available when the language was first introduced. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already read that post, please start there and come back when you&amp;rsquo;re finished. In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll learn about classes.&#xA;Classes:&#xA;You might remember that the mgmt language called mcl has both statements, and expressions.</description>

      <title>Mgmt Configuration Language</title>

      <description>Mgmt has given us a lot of great features, demos, and insight into how infrastructure automation should be managed. Unfortunately it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a complete tool yet, because it was missing a crucial piece for its completeness. That all changes today with the addition of: the language.&#xA;An ideal language allows us to express easily what is useful for the programming task, and at the same time makes it difficult to write what leads to incomprehensible or incorrect programs.</description>
