      <title>Five minute hacks: Swapping left and right headphone audio in wireplumber</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m on Fedora 37 at the moment. My headphone audio is backwards. How do we fix it? I&amp;rsquo;ve apparently never found the right magic until now.&#xA;The Setup:&#xA;I have a crappy &amp;ldquo;couch computer&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s used for casual internet browsing and video watching. It has an analog audio out which goes to my speakers. I&amp;rsquo;d like to use headphones for when I don&amp;rsquo;t want to annoy my neighbours. I have a pair of wireless headphones that I got for free, but the battery doesn&amp;rsquo;t last longer than an hour.</description>

      <title>Hyperlinks in GNOME terminal</title>

      <description>Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about many of the advantages of using a modern terminal and shell. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about using bash with GNOME terminal on a modern GNU/Linux distribution.&#xA;I particularly like switching between the terminal and GUI applications. It&amp;rsquo;s now even better.&#xA;Automatic Hyperlinks:&#xA;Occasionally, some program running in your shell might output what looked like a link:&#xA;gnome terminal and vte will automatically add links to text that looks like a web hyperlink or an email address They can be seen when you hover over them, and a right-click will display a useful context menu:</description>

      <description>As you may have noticed, we recently re-licensed mgmt from the AGPL (Affero General Public License) to the regular GPL. This is a post explaining the decision and which hopefully includes some insights at the intersection of technology and legal issues.&#xA;Disclaimer:&#xA;I am not a lawyer, and these are not necessarily the opinions of my employer. I think I&amp;rsquo;m knowledgeable in this area, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to be corrected in the comments.</description>

      <title>Extracting movies from libreoffice</title>

      <description>I have a short movie that I imported into a libreoffice presentation. I wanted a copy of that movie back, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to extract a copy. In desperation, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d try opening the file with file-roller, the GNOME archive manager.&#xA;james@computer:/tmp$ file mgmt-berlin-osdc-17may2017.odp mgmt-berlin-osdc-17may2017.odp: OpenDocument Presentation james@computer:/tmp$ mkdir out james@computer:/tmp$ file-roller -f mgmt-berlin-osdc-17may2017.odp -e out/ [snip] james@computer:/tmp$ cd out/ james@computer:/tmp/out$ ls Configurations2/ Media/ meta.xml Pictures/ styles.</description>

      <title>Matching arbitrary URL&#39;s to custom Firefox profiles</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re constantly clicking on all sorts of different URL&amp;rsquo;s throughout the day. These clickable links appear in webpages (including in &amp;ldquo;web apps&amp;rdquo; like gmail) in mail clients like Evolution, in terminals such as GNOME-terminal, and any other GTK+ app on your GNU/Linux desktop. I wanted to perform custom actions when arbitrary URL&amp;rsquo;s are clicked, including running certain links in separate Firefox profiles. There are a bunch of different steps you have to do to get this working, but it should be easy to follow along.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted a feature in Evolution for a while. It was formally requested in 2002, and it just recently got fixed in git master. I only started publicly groaning about this missing feature in 2013, and mcrha finally patched it. I tested the feature and found a small bug, mcrha patched that too, and I finally re-tested it. Now I&amp;rsquo;m blogging about this process so that you can get involved too!</description>

      <description>I usually avoid proprietary cloud services because of freedom, privacy and vendor lock-in concerns. In addition, there are some excellent libre (and hosted) services such as WordPress, Wikipedia and OpenShift which don&amp;rsquo;t have the above problems. Thirdly, there are every day Free Software tools such as Fedora GNU/Linux, Libreoffice, and git-annex-assistant which make my computing much more powerful. Finally, there are some hosted services that I use that don&amp;rsquo;t lock me in because I use them as push-only mirrors, and I only interact with them using Free Software tools.</description>

      <title>Preserving your working directory in gnome-terminal</title>

      <description>I use gnome-terminal for most of my hacking. In fact, I use it so much, that I&amp;rsquo;ll often have multiple tabs open for a particular project. Here&amp;rsquo;s my workflow:&#xA;Control+Alt+t (My shortcut to open a new gnome-terminal window.) cd ~/code/some_cool_hack/ # directory of some cool hack Control-Shift-t (Shortcut to open a new gnome-terminal tab.) Hack, hack, hack... The problem is that the new tab that I&#39;ve created will have a $PWD of ~, instead of keeping the $PWD of ~/code/some_cool_hack/, which is the project I&#39;m working on!</description>

      <description>This October 12th to 14th Montreal hosted the GNOME boston summit. Many thanks to Canonical for sponsoring breakfast, Savoir Faire Linux for hosting a great 6 à 10 with fancy snacks, and RedHat for sponsoring a pool night. What follows is some technical commentary about stuff that went on.&#xA;JHBuild&#xA;JHBuild is a tool to make it easy to download/clone (from git) and compile all the GNOME modules and applications. It was easy to get going.</description>

      <description>I just realized that my Fedora 19 installation didn&amp;rsquo;t have any of the GNOME games installed by default any more. I guess there&amp;rsquo;s no love for nibbles. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick one-liner to get them all back:&#xA;$ sudo yum search game | grep gnome | awk &amp;#39;{print $1}&amp;#39; | xargs sudo yum install -y Loaded plugins: etckeeper, langpacks, refresh-packagekit Package gnome-nibbles-3.8.0-2.fc19.x86_64 already installed and latest version Resolving Dependencies --&amp;gt; Running transaction check ---&amp;gt; Package gnome-chess.</description>

      <title>Upgrading from Fedora 18 to Fedora 19</title>

      <description>It was time to take the plunge and upgrade from Fedora 18 to Fedora 19. Fedora 18 was one of the worst releases ever, so I figured it could only get better. I ran my backups as usual, however this time I didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to need them, the upgrade process went off without a hitch! I used the fedup-cli process over the network. I always run these things inside of screen.</description>

      <description>I write this technical blog for you to enjoy, and to help me remember. So where do I get all this knowledge? I figure it out! Here&amp;rsquo;s how I learned to fix a small gedit annoyance in one minute, and within the next three, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to do the same for other types of problems too. Ready? Set? Go!&#xA;I use gedit enough, that when I hack, I often end up using up more than the five allotted spaces in the &amp;ldquo;recent files&amp;rdquo; sections.</description>

      <title>Picking up the pieces after a Fedora 18 install</title>

      <description>I love GNOME and Fedora, but &amp;ldquo;upgrading&amp;rdquo; from Fedora 17 to 18 did not go well for me. I recommend you wait until either these are all fixed, or Fedora 19+ suits your needs. Here are a list of problems I had, and some workarounds. Hopefully proper patches to these bugs will get merged quickly, so that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to use these fixes.&#xA;Problem: Boot fails after upgrade from Fedora 17 to Fedora 18.</description>

      <title>Renaming a GNOME keyring (for seahorse, the passwords and keyrings application)</title>

      <description>The GNOME Keyring is a great tool to unify password management across the desktop. Sadly, Firefox is the one application that doesn&amp;rsquo;t support this natively. (Chrome actually does!)&#xA;Seahorse is a useful tool to browse and manage your keyrings. Each keyring is physically stored in: ~/.gnome2/keyrings/$something.keyring&#xA;Usually the &amp;ldquo;$something&amp;rdquo;, matches the name of the keyring, however the real name comes from within the file. I had an older ubuntu machine running GNOME, and I wanted to import my keyring.</description>

      <title>changing *that* keyboard shortcut right there (in gnome)</title>

      <description>I love my keyboard shortcuts, and I sometimes I want to change them. If you&amp;rsquo;re ever in a gnome application and wanted to change that one right there, you can now live-edit them!&#xA;In a terminal, first enable this feature:&#xA;gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface can-change-accels true Next, hover over the menu item shortcut that you want to change. Enter the shortcut you want. It should update immediately! I like to disable this live-editing, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally change any shortcuts.</description>

      <description>So a friend of mine uses kde4 for its klipper feature. Turns out he&amp;rsquo;s right that it&amp;rsquo;s an awesome feature! I realized I couldn&amp;rsquo;t let gnome3 take second place to a clipboard app, so after a bit of searching&amp;hellip;&#xA;$ sudo yum install gnome-shell-extension-gpaste gpaste xsel Next hit up: https://extensions.gnome.org/local/ to flip on the extension. I had to first type: ALT-F2, &amp;ldquo;r&amp;rdquo; (to restart the gnome shell). Don&amp;rsquo;t worry your apps won&amp;rsquo;t die.</description>

      <description>since i do much research on the internets, i often find myself in a web browser. my favourite of the lot is epiphany. this post isn&amp;rsquo;t about its merits or failures, but about the awesome way to make my location bar be exactly how i like it: monospaced.&#xA;just add the following into your ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file and then restart epiphany. feel free to modify as you wish.&#xA;# ~/.gtkrc-2.0 style &amp;#34;Epiphany_Locationbar&amp;#34; { # leave out the font size if you wish font_name = &amp;#34;Monospace 12&amp;#34; #bg[NORMAL] = &amp;#34;#ff0000&amp;#34; } # both of these seem to work.</description>

      <title>multi monitors and how it should all work (long babble)</title>

      <description>at work i use two screens for my day to day workflow. i find it&amp;rsquo;s much more efficient for doing work, like coding. i&amp;rsquo;ll often have at least one terminal open, a full screen text editor, and usually a number of references, such as the dbus specification open in a web browser.&#xA;i recently just realized that one of the reasons multiple monitors are so useful to me, isn&amp;rsquo;t because of the increased screen real estate (although that certaintly is an important factor) but because of how the window manager deals with the windows.</description>

      <description>after a recent upgrade to ubuntu 9.04, it seems that i&amp;rsquo;ve been pushed into using some &amp;ldquo;unfeatures&amp;rdquo; that i didn&amp;rsquo;t ask for. well apparently they won&amp;rsquo;t be unfeatures forever, but for me, notify-osd and indicator-applet aren&amp;rsquo;t quite ready for my consumption. i realize that ubuntu is trying to improve the desktop experience, but i&amp;rsquo;m going to need to wait for some more polish first.&#xA;so how do i get rid of these horrible things ?</description>
