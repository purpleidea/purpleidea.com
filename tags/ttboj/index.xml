      <description>The Technical Blog of James was seen on an outdoor electronic display in downtown Montreal! Thanks to one of my readers for sending this in.&#xA;I guess the smart phone revolution is over, and people are taking to reading my articles on bigger screens! The &#34;poutine&#34; is decent proof that this is probably Montreal. If you&amp;rsquo;ve got access to a large electronic display, put up the blog, snap a photo, and send it my way!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m now syndicated on the Fedora Project planet. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read through my blog yet, let me introduce myself, I&amp;rsquo;m James, and I write The Technical Blog of James.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m a sysadmin, DevOps/Puppet hacker, I.T./network architect and physiologist. Hi! I run Fedora as my primary desktop, but I also use it for servers, particularly for development before future versions of RHEL and CentOS release.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m most well-known for Puppet-Gluster, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also written a decent Puppet-IPA (FreeIPA) module.</description>
