      <description>I use the Evolution mail client. It does have a few annoying bugs, but it has a plethora of great features too! Hopefully this post will inspire you to help hack on this piece of software and fix the bugs!&#xA;Mailing list etiquette:&#xA;When replying to mailing lists, it&amp;rsquo;s typically very friendly to include the email address of the person you&amp;rsquo;re replying to in the to or cc fields along with the mailing list address.</description>

      <title>Multifile mode for text editors</title>

      <description>Dear internets,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m a sysadmin/architect, which means I spend a good amount of time coding in puppet and other languages. Puppet is a great tool, however the puppet community is a bit anal strict about their style policies. I can respect this because I understand how important uniformity is when many developers are sharing code.&#xA;(On a side note, I absolutely can&amp;rsquo;t stand using spaces for indentation, but that&amp;rsquo;s another story.</description>

      <description>i use gnu/linux. it&amp;rsquo;s probably no secret. what is more of a secret, is that i secretly (well actually not so secretly) love using gedit for editing text. i still use vim, echo (gnu bash) and emacs (but only for org-mode).&#xA;vim is really, really great. but for day to day full-screen coding, i love working in gedit. i only have one [1] longstanding gripe, and today i believe that it is solved.</description>
