      <description>Dear internets,&#xA;During my daily grind of computer architecturing, I often learn something new that I wish a mentor had taught me earlier. I will post my babbles here, so that the interested might learn, and for the wiser to comment on.&#xA;Happy Hacking!&#xA;James&#xA;PS: I had a previous blog, but that server was taken down. It has been merged into this one!&#xA;You can hire James and his team at m9rx corporation.</description>
