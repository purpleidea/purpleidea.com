      <description>i have this software with a gtk mainloop, using dbus and all that fun stuff that seems to play together nicely. i know about the kernel inotify support, and i wanted it to get integrated with that above stack. i thought i was supposed to do it with pyinotify and io_add_watch, but on closer inspection into the pyinotify code it turns out that it seems to actually use polling!

      <description>the software (evanescent) that i&amp;rsquo;m working on is supposed to log out the user from its current X session. originally i had some yucky looking code that ran a kill on gnome-session, which quickly got replaced with:&#xA;os.system(&amp;#39;gnome-session-save --logout-dialog&amp;#39;) i&amp;rsquo;ve decided this was still a little crufty, so i&amp;rsquo;ve recently replaced this with:&#xA;bus = dbus.SessionBus() remote_object = bus.get_object(&amp;#39;org.gnome.SessionManager&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;/org/gnome/SessionManager&amp;#39;) # specify the dbus_interface in each call remote_object.Logout(0, dbus_interface=&amp;#39;org.gnome.SessionManager&amp;#39;) # or create an Interface wrapper for the remote object #iface = dbus.</description>
