      <description>Sometimes while I&amp;rsquo;m deep inside mgmt&amp;rsquo;s project directory, I want to run an operation from the Makefile which lives in the root! Unfortunately, if you do so while nested, you&amp;rsquo;ll just get:&#xA;james@computer:~/code/mgmt/resources$ make build make: *** No rule to make target &amp;#39;build&amp;#39;. Stop. The Ten Minute Solution:&#xA;I figured I&amp;rsquo;d hack out a quick solution. What I came up with looks like this:&#xA;#!/bin/bash # James Shubin, 2018 # run `make` in the first directory (or its parent recursively) that it works in MF=&amp;#39;Makefile&amp;#39;&#x9;# looks for this file, could look for others, but that&amp;#39;s silly CWD=$(pwd)&#x9;# starting here while true; do if [ -e &amp;#34;$MF&amp;#34; ]; then make $@&#x9;# run make!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m old school and still rocking an old X220 laptop because I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the new ones. My battery life isn&amp;rsquo;t as great as I&amp;rsquo;d like it to be, but it gets worse when some &amp;ldquo;webapp&amp;rdquo; (which I&amp;rsquo;d much rather have as a native GTK+ app) causes Firefox to rev my CPU with their websocket (hi gmail!) poller.&#xA;This seems to happen most often on planes or when I&amp;rsquo;m disconnected from the internet.</description>

      <title>Ten minute hacks: Hacking airplane headphones</title>

      <description>I was stuck on a 14 hour flight last week, and to my disappointment, only one of the two headphone speakers were working. The plane&amp;rsquo;s media centre has an audio connector that looks like this:&#xA;Someone should consider probing this USB port. The hole to the left is smaller than a 3.5mm headphone jack, and designed for a proprietary headphone connector that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have, and the two holes to the right are part of a different proprietary connector which match with the cheap airline headphones to provide the left and right audio channels.</description>
