      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve now heard, Red Hat is being acquired by IBM.&#xA;Reactions have ranged from:&#xA;The first two emotions everyone experienced. to:&#xA;The classic humourous response. to:&#xA;The classy response. to:&#xA;The thing we&amp;#39;re all curious about. to everything in between. If someone were to leak me a copy of the memo-list 2018-October.txt.gz mailman archive, I&amp;rsquo;d sure love to see that! (Of course I&amp;rsquo;m joking and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t actually ask anyone to do this.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent about four years at Red Hat, and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to move on&amp;hellip;&#xA;TL;DR: had to leave Red Hat and start Patreon to fund mgmt.&#xA;What follows is a bit of historical rambling, and some forward looking statements.&#xA;Retrospective:&#xA;Long-time readers of my blog will know that I was very active in the puppet ecosystem for many years. I learned a lot while writing puppet code, and while building some of my outrageous puppet hacks.</description>

      <title>Kubernetes clusters with Oh-My-Vagrant</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve added the ability to deploy a Kubernetes cluster with Oh-My-Vagrant (omv). I&amp;rsquo;ve also built an automated developer experience so that you can test your Kubernetes powered app in minutes. If you want to redeploy a new version, or see how your app behaves during a rolling update, you can use omv to test this out in minutes! I&amp;rsquo;ve recorded a screencast (~15 min), if you&amp;rsquo;d like to see some of this in action.</description>

      <description>So this happened:&#xA;James just James at RedHat headquarters in North Carolina wearing his new red hat. RedHat made me an offer, and I am happy to say that I have just started this week!&#xA;I am proud to have joined a company that employs many of the worlds foremost, highly professional and clever hackers. It isÂ indubitably the best Free Software [1] / Open Source company out there, and they ship some of the greatest and most elegant software available.</description>

      <description>John Mark Walker, (from Redhat) has been kind enough to invite me to speak at the Linuxcon Gluster Workshop in New Orleans. I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking about puppet-gluster, giving demos, and hopefully showing off some new features. I&amp;rsquo;m also looking forward to meeting up with gluster expert Joe Julian.&#xA;If there are features that puppet-gluster is missing, or you have a use case that I haven&amp;rsquo;t covered, please let me know, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to work on it for you ahead of the conference.</description>
