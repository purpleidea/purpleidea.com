      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a brand new core feature in mgmt called send/recv which I plan to show you shortly, but first I&amp;rsquo;d like to start with some background.&#xA;History&#xA;This is my historical perspective and interpretation about the last twenty years in configuration management. It&amp;rsquo;s likely inaccurate and slightly revisionist, but it should be correct enough to tell the design story that I want to share.&#xA;Sometime after people started to realize that writing bash scripts wasn&amp;rsquo;t a safe, scalable, or reusable way to automate systems, CFEngine burst onto the scene with the first real solution to this problem.</description>

      <description>(Note: this hybrid management technique is being demonstrated in the puppet-ipa module for FreeIPA, but the idea could be used for other modules and scenarios too. See below for some use cases&amp;hellip;)&#xA;The error message that puppet hackers are probably most familiar is:&#xA;Error: Duplicate declaration: Thing[/foo/bar] is already declared in file /tmp/baz.pp:2; cannot redeclare at /tmp/baz.pp:4 on node computer.example.com Typically this means that there is either a bug in your code, or someone has defined something more than once.</description>
