      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing some massively concurrent code for mgmt lately. The concurrency makes it incredibly bug prone. In this case it&amp;rsquo;s usually races or deadlocks. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a new trick to make the process more pleasant.&#xA;The Problem:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m sure many of you have written some code like this before:&#xA;// just a small excerpt for { select { case &amp;lt;-someEvent: // some awesome thing happened! case &amp;lt;-ctx.Done(): return ctx.Err() } } And during debugging, you might have gotten frustrated and added some printf&amp;rsquo;s:</description>

      <title>Deadline context test cancellation in golang</title>

      <description>I decided to write a fancy test harness in golang today. The test wraps a big internal engine for mgmt and at the top-level it takes a context for cancellation. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know about the context package, then you should go understand that and then come back here&amp;hellip; Don&amp;rsquo;t feel bad, I had no idea what it was about at first either!&#xA;The Problem:&#xA;I assumed there would be some way to follow a notification from the test runner down into my test to tell it when it was time to cleanup and exit early&amp;hellip; I expected that making my own ^C signal handler wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be correct, and I (incorrectly) assumed that the interface I&amp;rsquo;d be looking for would offer a golang context that I could pass into my code.</description>

      <title>Automatic grouping in mgmt</title>

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you about the recently released &amp;ldquo;automatic grouping&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;AutoGroup&amp;rdquo; feature in mgmt, a next generation configuration management prototype. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t already familiar with mgmt, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend you start by reading the introductory post, and the second post. There&amp;rsquo;s also an introductory video.&#xA;Resources in a graph&#xA;Most configuration management systems use something called a directed acyclic graph, or DAG. This is a fancy way of saying that it is a bunch of circles (vertices) which are connected with arrows (edges).</description>

      <title>Testing GlusterFS during “Glusterfest”</title>

      <description>The GlusterFS community is having a &amp;ldquo;test day&amp;rdquo;. Puppet-Gluster+Vagrant is a great tool to help with this, and it has now been patched to support alpha, beta, qa, and rc releases! Because it was built so well (*cough*, shameless plug), it only took one patch.&#xA;Okay, first make sure that your Puppet-Gluster+Vagrant setup is working properly. I have only tested this on Fedora 20. Please read:&#xA;Automatically deploying GlusterFS with Puppet-Gluster+Vagrant!</description>

      <description>Puppet-Gluster was always about automating the deployment of GlusterFS. Getting your own Puppet server and the associated infrastructure running was never included &amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo;. Today, it is! (This is big news!)&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Vagrant to automatically build these GlusterFS clusters. I&amp;rsquo;ve tested this with Fedora 20, and vagrant-libvirt. This won&amp;rsquo;t work with Fedora 19 because of bz#876541. I recommend first reading my earlier articles for Vagrant and Fedora:</description>
