      <description>I publicly released mgmt to the internet 10 years ago. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been 10 years. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about:&#xA;The new mgmt company A one-time new customer offer Unexpected wins Past failures Some history A new release And more&amp;hellip;&#xA;The company:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve officially started a company. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this for some time now, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to let you all know about it officially. As you already know (mgmt, purpleidea, etc&amp;hellip;) I&amp;rsquo;ve never been great at naming.</description>

      <title>Running etcd over SSH</title>

      <description>Want to tunnel etcd traffic over SSH? Here&amp;rsquo;s a pitfall I ran into.&#xA;The problem:&#xA;Mgmt supports tunnelling the etcd traffic over SSH. This is quite useful, because it means that for it to connect to etcd, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to open up any new ports other than 22.&#xA;You can run the agent like so:&#xA;mgmt run --ssh-url=etcd@etcdserver:22 --seeds=http://127.0.0.1:2379 --no-server --no-magic empty and it just works!&#xA;Lockdown:&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s no fun giving out more access than is really necessary, so I added this line to the etcd user account in their ~/.</description>

      <title>Working around an iPXE issue</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2025/01/23/working-around-an-ipxe-issue/</link>

      <description>iPXE is a terrific tool, but despite their very respectable documentation, it has some rough edges, and it still feels like an &amp;ldquo;in crowd&amp;rdquo; kind of thing, where you have to learn the common tricks by knowing someone.&#xA;The problem:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been building a provisioning tool in mgmt and instead of always relying on distro-specific boot images, I decided to use iPXE to handle the early boot, and have it hand-off to the kernel installer.</description>

      <title>Modules and imports in mgmt</title>

      <description>Mgmt modules are used for structuring your code across multiple files. This keeps things readable and allows for code reusability. For example, it should be easy to write a single module which can be effectively used by many different parties. To me, it never felt like code reuse was a core design objective with other tools. In mgmt it has been since the very beginning. I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of our module system, so let me introduce you to it properly.</description>

      <title>Mgmt Configuration Language: Functions</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2024/11/22/functions-in-mgmt/</link>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a little while since I introduced the Mgmt Configuration Language. I originally wrote this article in 2019, and as I was working on it alongside the code for functions, when I realized that lambdas didn&amp;rsquo;t work properly. It took some time to finally solve that properly. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been working to get mgmt production ready. It&amp;rsquo;s properly useful for production now, and so it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to catch up on my documentation.</description>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m announcing a new type of provisioning tool. This is both the culmination of a long road, and the start of a new era. Please read on for all of the details. Feel free to skip to the relevant sections you&amp;rsquo;re interested in if you don&amp;rsquo;t want all of the background.&#xA;Ten years:&#xA;The vision for this specific tool started around ten years ago. Previously, as a sysadmin, I spent a lot of my time using a configuration management tool called puppet.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a little over a year since I introduced the Mgmt Configuration Language. A lot has happened since then, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce some of the missing features that weren&amp;rsquo;t available when the language was first introduced. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already read that post, please start there and come back when you&amp;rsquo;re finished. In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll learn about classes.&#xA;Classes:&#xA;You might remember that the mgmt language called mcl has both statements, and expressions.</description>

      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2018/02/05/mgmt-configuration-language/</link>

      <description>Mgmt has given us a lot of great features, demos, and insight into how infrastructure automation should be managed. Unfortunately it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a complete tool yet, because it was missing a crucial piece for its completeness. That all changes today with the addition of: the language.&#xA;An ideal language allows us to express easily what is useful for the programming task, and at the same time makes it difficult to write what leads to incomprehensible or incorrect programs.</description>

      <description>As you may have noticed, we recently re-licensed mgmt from the AGPL (Affero General Public License) to the regular GPL. This is a post explaining the decision and which hopefully includes some insights at the intersection of technology and legal issues.&#xA;Disclaimer:&#xA;I am not a lawyer, and these are not necessarily the opinions of my employer. I think I&amp;rsquo;m knowledgeable in this area, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to be corrected in the comments.</description>

      <title>Metaparameters in mgmt</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2017/03/01/metaparameters-in-mgmt/</link>

      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2017/03/01/metaparameters-in-mgmt/</guid>
      <description>In mgmt we have meta parameters. They are similar in concept to what you might be familiar with from other tools, except that they are more clearly defined (in a single struct) and vastly more powerful.&#xA;In mgmt, a meta parameter is a parameter which is codified entirely in the engine, and which can be used by any resource. In contrast with Puppet, require/before are considered meta parameters, whereas in mgmt, the equivalent is a graph edge, which is not a meta parameter.</description>

      <title>Send/Recv in mgmt</title>

      <description>I previously published &amp;ldquo;A revisionist history of configuration management&amp;rdquo;. I meant for that to be the intro to this article, but it ended up being long enough that it deserved a separate post. I will explain Send/Recv in this article, but first a few clarifications to the aforementioned article.&#xA;Clarifications&#xA;I mentioned that my &amp;ldquo;revisionist history&amp;rdquo; was inaccurate, but I failed to mention that it was also not exhaustive! Many things were left out either because they were proprietary, niche, not well-known, of obscure design or simply for brevity.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a brand new core feature in mgmt called send/recv which I plan to show you shortly, but first I&amp;rsquo;d like to start with some background.&#xA;History&#xA;This is my historical perspective and interpretation about the last twenty years in configuration management. It&amp;rsquo;s likely inaccurate and slightly revisionist, but it should be correct enough to tell the design story that I want to share.&#xA;Sometime after people started to realize that writing bash scripts wasn&amp;rsquo;t a safe, scalable, or reusable way to automate systems, CFEngine burst onto the scene with the first real solution to this problem.</description>

      <title>Remote execution in mgmt</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2016/10/07/remote-execution-in-mgmt/</link>

      <description>Bootstrapping a cluster from your laptop, or managing machines without needing to first setup a separate config management infrastructure are both very reasonable and fundamental asks. I was particularly inspired by Ansible&amp;rsquo;s agent-less remote execution model, but never wanted to build a centralized orchestrator. I soon realized that I could have my ice cream and eat it too.&#xA;Prior knowledge&#xA;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the earlier articles about mgmt, then I recommend you start with those, and then come back here.</description>

      <title>Automatic clustering in mgmt</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2016/06/20/automatic-clustering-in-mgmt/</link>

      <description>In mgmt, deploying and managing your clustered config management infrastructure needs to be as automatic as the infrastructure you&amp;rsquo;re using mgmt to manage. With mgmt, instead of a centralized data store, we function as a distributed system, built on top of etcd and the raft protocol.&#xA;In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover how this feature works.&#xA;Foreword:&#xA;Mgmt is a next generation configuration management project. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of it yet, or you don&amp;rsquo;t remember why we use a distributed database, start by reading the previous articles:</description>

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you about the recently released &amp;ldquo;automatic grouping&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;AutoGroup&amp;rdquo; feature in mgmt, a next generation configuration management prototype. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t already familiar with mgmt, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend you start by reading the introductory post, and the second post. There&amp;rsquo;s also an introductory video.&#xA;Resources in a graph&#xA;Most configuration management systems use something called a directed acyclic graph, or DAG. This is a fancy way of saying that it is a bunch of circles (vertices) which are connected with arrows (edges).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been two months since I announced mgmt, and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to continue the story by telling you more about the design of what&amp;rsquo;s now in git master. Before I get into those details, let me quickly recap what&amp;rsquo;s happened since then.&#xA;Mgmt community recap:&#xA;I gave the first public presentation about mgmt at CfgMgmtCamp. I repeated the talk at DevConf.cz. The video recording is available. Felix wrote about his work cross compiling puppet code to mgmt.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret to the readers of this blog that I&amp;rsquo;ve been active in the configuration management space for some time. I owe most of my knowledge to what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned while working with Puppet and from other hackers working in and around various other communities.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve published, a number, of articles, in an, attempt, to push, the field, forwards, and to, share the, knowledge, that I&amp;rsquo;ve, learned, with others. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent many nights thinking about these problems, but it is not without some chagrin that I realized that the current state-of-the-art in configuration management cannot easily (or elegantly) solve all the problems for which I wish to write solutions.</description>
