      <title>Running `make` from anywhere</title>

      <description>Sometimes while I&amp;rsquo;m deep inside mgmt&amp;rsquo;s project directory, I want to run an operation from the Makefile which lives in the root! Unfortunately, if you do so while nested, you&amp;rsquo;ll just get:&#xA;james@computer:~/code/mgmt/resources$ make build make: *** No rule to make target &amp;#39;build&amp;#39;. Stop. The Ten Minute Solution:&#xA;I figured I&amp;rsquo;d hack out a quick solution. What I came up with looks like this:&#xA;#!/bin/bash # James Shubin, 2018 # run `make` in the first directory (or its parent recursively) that it works in MF=&amp;#39;Makefile&amp;#39;&#x9;# looks for this file, could look for others, but that&amp;#39;s silly CWD=$(pwd)&#x9;# starting here while true; do if [ -e &amp;#34;$MF&amp;#34; ]; then make $@&#x9;# run make!</description>

      <title>Git archive with submodules and tar magic</title>

      <description>Git submodules are actually a very beautiful thing. You might prefer the word powerful or elegant, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the point. The downside is that they are sometimes misused, so as always, use with care. I&amp;rsquo;ve used them in projects like puppet-gluster, oh-my-vagrant, and others. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with them, do a bit of reading and come back later, I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.&#xA;I recently did some work packaging Oh-My-Vagrant as RPM&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <title>Building base images for Vagrant with a Makefile</title>

      <description>I needed a base image &amp;ldquo;box&amp;rdquo; for my Puppet-Gluster+Vagrant work. It would have been great if good boxes already existed, and even better if it were easy to build my own. As it turns out, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to satisfy either of these conditions, so I&amp;rsquo;ve had to build one myself! I&amp;rsquo;ve published all of my code, so that you can use these techniques and tools too!&#xA;Status quo:&#xA;Having an NIH problem is bad for your vision, and it&amp;rsquo;s best to benefit from existing tools before creating your own.</description>

      <title>scary cool bash scripting inside a Makefile</title>

      <description>Makefiles are both scary and wonderful. When both these adjectives are involved, it often makes for interesting hacking. This is likely the reason I use bash.&#xA;In any case, I digress, back to real work. I use Makefiles as a general purpose tool to launch any of a number of shell scripts which I use to maintain my code, and instead of actually having external shell scripts, I just build any necessary bash right into the Makefile.</description>
