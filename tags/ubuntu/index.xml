      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m here in New Orleans hacking up a storm and getting to meet fellow gluster users IRL. John Mark Walker started off with a great &amp;ldquo;State of the GlusterFS union&amp;rdquo; style talk.&#xA;Today Louis (semiosis) gave a great talk about running glusterfs on amazon. It was highly pragmatic and he explained how he chose the number of bricks per host. The talk will be posted online shortly.&#xA;Marco Ceppi from Canonical gave a talk about juju and gluster.</description>

      <description>Continuing on from yesterday, I&amp;rsquo;ve met even more interesting people. I chatted with Dianne Mueller about some interesting ideas for gluster+openshift. More to come on that front soon. Hung out with Jono Bacon and talked a bit about puppet-gluster on Ubuntu. If there is interest in the community for this, please let me know. Thanks to John Mark Walker and RedHat for sponsoring me and introducing me to many of these folks.</description>
