      <title>The switch as an ordinary GNU/Linux server</title>

      <description>The fact that we manage the switches in our data centres differently than any other server is patently absurd, but we do so because we want to harness the power of a tiny bit of silicon which happens to be able to dramatically speed up the switching bandwidth.&#xA;beware of proprietary silicon, it&#39;s absurd! That tiny bit of silicon is known as an ASIC, or an application specific integrated circuit, and one particularly well performing ASIC (which is present in many commercially available switches) is called the Trident.</description>

      <title>Building base images for Vagrant with a Makefile</title>

      <description>I needed a base image &amp;ldquo;box&amp;rdquo; for my Puppet-Gluster+Vagrant work. It would have been great if good boxes already existed, and even better if it were easy to build my own. As it turns out, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to satisfy either of these conditions, so I&amp;rsquo;ve had to build one myself! I&amp;rsquo;ve published all of my code, so that you can use these techniques and tools too!&#xA;Status quo:&#xA;Having an NIH problem is bad for your vision, and it&amp;rsquo;s best to benefit from existing tools before creating your own.</description>

      <title>New puppet-gluster features before Linuxcon</title>

      <description>Hey there,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve done a bit of puppet-gluster hacking lately to try to squeeze some extra features and testing in before Linuxcon. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short list:&#xA;SELinux fixes to keep Dan Walsh happy :) Ping and status checks before volume creation. Now puppet-gluster will be less noisy about failures or missing executions that are due to the necessary incremental nature of puppet-gluster runs. You&#39;ll need multiple puppet runs to get a complete setup, so don&#39;t let puppet complain part way through.</description>

      <title>Upgrading to centos 6.4 with shorewall onboard</title>

      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/04/25/upgrading-to-centos-6-4-with-shorewall-onboard/</guid>
      <description>In case you upgrade your CentOS 6.x box to version 6.4, the shorewall service might complain. With a scary message:&#xA;ERROR: Your kernel/iptables do not include state match support. No version of Shorewall will run on this system This is selinux at work, and the problem can easily be solved by running:&#xA;# restorecon -Rv /sbin Thanks shorewall-users and&#xA;Happy hacking,&#xA;James&#xA;You can hire James and his team at m9rx corporation.</description>

      <title>SElinux causes pain when using puppet 2.x with hiera</title>

      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/01/17/selinux-causes-pain-when-using-puppet-2-x-with-hiera/</guid>
      <description>So hiera wasn&amp;rsquo;t working when used through my puppetmaster. It worked perfectly when I was running my scripts manually with: puppet apply site.pp but the moment I switched over to regular puppetmasterd usage, everything went dead.&#xA;I realized a while back, that I could always expect some hiera failures from time to time. Whether this is hiera&amp;rsquo;s fault or not is irrelevant, the relevant part is that I quickly added:</description>

      <title>Clustering virtual machines with rgmanager and clusvcadm</title>

      <description>This could be a post detailing how to host clustered virtual machines with rgmanager and clusvcadm, but that is a longer story and there is much work to do. For now, I will give you a short version including an informative &amp;ldquo;gotcha&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;With my cluster up and running, I added a virtual machine entry to my cluster.conf:&#xA;&amp;lt;vm name=&amp;#34;test1&amp;#34; domain=&amp;#34;somedomain&amp;#34; path=&amp;#34;/shared/vm/&amp;#34; autostart=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; exclusive=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; recovery=&amp;#34;restart&amp;#34; use_virsh=&amp;#34;1&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; This goes inside the block.</description>
