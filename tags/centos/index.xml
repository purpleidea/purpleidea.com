      <description>My employer keeps paying me, which I appreciate, so it&amp;rsquo;s good to spend some time to make sure RHEL7 customers get a great developer experience! So here&amp;rsquo;s how to make vagrant, vagrant-libvirt and Oh-My-Vagrant work on RHEL 7+. The same steps should work for CentOS 7+.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll first paste the commands you need to run, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what&amp;rsquo;s happening for those that are interested:&#xA;# run these commands, and then get hacking!</description>

      <title>Docker containers in Oh-My-Vagrant</title>

      <description>The Oh-My-Vagrant (omv) project is an easy way to bootstrap a development environment. It is particularly useful for spinning up an arbitrary number of virtual machines in Vagrant without writing ruby code. For multi-machine container development, omv can be used to help this happen more naturally.&#xA;Oh-My-Vagrant can be very useful as a docker application development environment. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a quick (&amp;lt;9min) screencast demoing this topic. Please have a look:</description>

      <title>Building RHEL Vagrant Boxes with Vagrant-Builder</title>

      <description>Vagrant is a great tool for development, but Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) customers have typically been left out, because it has been impossible to get RHEL boxes! It would be extremely elegant if hackers could quickly test and prototype their code on the same OS as they&amp;rsquo;re running in production.&#xA;Secondly, when hacking on projects that have a long initial setup phase (eg: a long rpm install) it would be excellent if hackers could roll their own modified base boxes, so that certain common operations could be re-factored out into the base image.</description>

      <title>Puppet-Gluster now available as RPM</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been afraid of RPM and package maintaining [1] for years, but thanks to Kaleb Keithley, I have finally made some RPM&amp;rsquo;s that weren&amp;rsquo;t generated from a high level tool. Now that I have the boilerplate done, it&amp;rsquo;s a relatively painless process!&#xA;In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know kkeithley, he is a wizard [2] who happens to also be especially cool and hardworking. If you meet him, be sure to buy him a $BEVERAGE.</description>

      <title>Screencasts of Puppet-Gluster &#43; Vagrant</title>

      <description>I decided to record some screencasts to show how easy it is to deploy GlusterFS using Puppet-Gluster+Vagrant. You can follow along even if you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about Puppet or Vagrant. The hardest part of this process was producing the actual videos!&#xA;If recommend first reading my earlier articles if you&amp;rsquo;re planning on following along:&#xA;Vagrant on Fedora with libvirt Vagrant vsftp and other tricks Vagrant clustered SSH and &#39;screen&#39; Automatically deploying GlusterFS with Puppet-Gluster + Vagrant!</description>

      <title>Building base images for Vagrant with a Makefile</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2014/01/20/building-base-images-for-vagrant-with-a-makefile/</link>

      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2014/01/20/building-base-images-for-vagrant-with-a-makefile/</guid>
      <description>I needed a base image &amp;ldquo;box&amp;rdquo; for my Puppet-Gluster+Vagrant work. It would have been great if good boxes already existed, and even better if it were easy to build my own. As it turns out, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to satisfy either of these conditions, so I&amp;rsquo;ve had to build one myself! I&amp;rsquo;ve published all of my code, so that you can use these techniques and tools too!&#xA;Status quo:&#xA;Having an NIH problem is bad for your vision, and it&amp;rsquo;s best to benefit from existing tools before creating your own.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m now syndicated on the Fedora Project planet. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read through my blog yet, let me introduce myself, I&amp;rsquo;m James, and I write The Technical Blog of James.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m a sysadmin, DevOps/Puppet hacker, I.T./network architect and physiologist. Hi! I run Fedora as my primary desktop, but I also use it for servers, particularly for development before future versions of RHEL and CentOS release.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m most well-known for Puppet-Gluster, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also written a decent Puppet-IPA (FreeIPA) module.</description>

      <title>Upgrading to centos 6.4 with shorewall onboard</title>

      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/04/25/upgrading-to-centos-6-4-with-shorewall-onboard/</guid>
      <description>In case you upgrade your CentOS 6.x box to version 6.4, the shorewall service might complain. With a scary message:&#xA;ERROR: Your kernel/iptables do not include state match support. No version of Shorewall will run on this system This is selinux at work, and the problem can easily be solved by running:&#xA;# restorecon -Rv /sbin Thanks shorewall-users and&#xA;Happy hacking,&#xA;James&#xA;You can hire James and his team at m9rx corporation.</description>

      <title>adding range support to python&#39;s http server to kickstart with anaconda</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/03/14/adding-range-support-to-pythons-http-server-to-kickstart-with-anaconda/</link>

      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/03/14/adding-range-support-to-pythons-http-server-to-kickstart-with-anaconda/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on automatic installs using kickstart and puppet. I&amp;rsquo;m using a modified python httpserver because it&amp;rsquo;s lightweight, and easy to integrate into my existing python code base. The server was churning away perfectly until anaconda started downloading the full rpm&amp;rsquo;s for installation. What was going wrong?&#xA;Traceback (most recent call last): [...] error: [Errno 32] Broken pipe BorkedError: See TTBOJ for explanation and discussion As it turns out, anaconda first downloads the headers, and then later requests the full rpm with an http range request.</description>
