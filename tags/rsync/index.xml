      <description>As I previously wrote, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with Vagrant on Fedora with libvirt, and have even been submitting, patches and issues! (This &amp;ldquo;closed&amp;rdquo; issue needs solving!) Here are some of the tricks that I&amp;rsquo;ve used while hacking away.&#xA;Default provider:&#xA;I should have mentioned this in my earlier article but I forgot: If you&amp;rsquo;re always using the same provider, you might want to set it as the default. In my case I&amp;rsquo;m using vagrant-libvirt.</description>

      <description>Theron Conrey writes about using:&#xA;BitTorrent Sync as Geo-Replication for Storage We got a chance to talk about this idea at Linuxcon. I&#39;m not entirely convinced there aren&#39;t some problem edge cases with this solution, but I think it will be hard to tell as long as the BitTorrent sync library is proprietary. I did come up with a special case of Theron&#39;s idea that I believe could work well. The special case uses the optimization that the synchronization (or file transferring) is unidirectional.</description>

      <description>Dear internets,&#xA;Once upon a time, I had one of those &amp;ldquo;brain teaser-of-the-day&amp;rdquo; calendars. Free business tip: someone should make an &amp;lsquo;rsync&amp;rsquo; version. That would be brilliant. (If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what rsync is, then you should probably go read a different blog.)&#xA;Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s used kvm might know, linux virtual machines can have sparse .raw file backing stores. This means the operating system could think it has one TiB of space, when it is actually sharing a one TiB physical harddrive with many others.</description>
