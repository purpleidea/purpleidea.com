      <description>In an earlier post, I got USB audio working on my used, manual, 2013 Honda Civic EX. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll do the same for a Sony ZS-RS60BT boombox.&#xA;Here it is in all its used glory after a little cleaning. Background:&#xA;I decided I should get a small portable boombox to practice my dope dance moves. I currently still suck because I think I spend more time computering than out on the floor.</description>

      <description>Transportation is very important to me. My whole life I&amp;rsquo;ve never owned a car. I have gotten by with biking, public transit, and various car sharing services. Sadly, biking is incredibly dangerous and stressful, because most cars don&amp;rsquo;t respect bicycles, and in the winter it&amp;rsquo;s not very practical, the STM (public transit) offers an incredibly unreliable and unpleasant service, and Car2Go (car sharing) now requires that you use their proprietary smart phone app (you used to be able to just swipe the membership card) so I finally gave up and decided to buy a used car.</description>
