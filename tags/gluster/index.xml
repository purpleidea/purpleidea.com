      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent about four years at Red Hat, and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to move on&amp;hellip;&#xA;TL;DR: had to leave Red Hat and start Patreon to fund mgmt.&#xA;What follows is a bit of historical rambling, and some forward looking statements.&#xA;Retrospective:&#xA;Long-time readers of my blog will know that I was very active in the puppet ecosystem for many years. I learned a lot while writing puppet code, and while building some of my outrageous puppet hacks.</description>

      <description>As you may have noticed, we recently re-licensed mgmt from the AGPL (Affero General Public License) to the regular GPL. This is a post explaining the decision and which hopefully includes some insights at the intersection of technology and legal issues.&#xA;Disclaimer:&#xA;I am not a lawyer, and these are not necessarily the opinions of my employer. I think I&amp;rsquo;m knowledgeable in this area, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to be corrected in the comments.</description>

      <title>Metaparameters in mgmt</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2017/03/01/metaparameters-in-mgmt/</link>

      <description>In mgmt we have meta parameters. They are similar in concept to what you might be familiar with from other tools, except that they are more clearly defined (in a single struct) and vastly more powerful.&#xA;In mgmt, a meta parameter is a parameter which is codified entirely in the engine, and which can be used by any resource. In contrast with Puppet, require/before are considered meta parameters, whereas in mgmt, the equivalent is a graph edge, which is not a meta parameter.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been hacking in golang since before version 1.4, and the speed at which my builds finished has been mostly trending downwards. Let&amp;rsquo;s look into the reasons and some fixes.

      <description>Bootstrapping a cluster from your laptop, or managing machines without needing to first setup a separate config management infrastructure are both very reasonable and fundamental asks. I was particularly inspired by Ansible&amp;rsquo;s agent-less remote execution model, but never wanted to build a centralized orchestrator. I soon realized that I could have my ice cream and eat it too.&#xA;Prior knowledge&#xA;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the earlier articles about mgmt, then I recommend you start with those, and then come back here.</description>

      <description>The Technical Blog of James was seen on an outdoor electronic display in downtown Montreal! Thanks to one of my readers for sending this in.&#xA;I guess the smart phone revolution is over, and people are taking to reading my articles on bigger screens! The &#34;poutine&#34; is decent proof that this is probably Montreal. If you&amp;rsquo;ve got access to a large electronic display, put up the blog, snap a photo, and send it my way!</description>

      <title>Automatic clustering in mgmt</title>

      <description>In mgmt, deploying and managing your clustered config management infrastructure needs to be as automatic as the infrastructure you&amp;rsquo;re using mgmt to manage. With mgmt, instead of a centralized data store, we function as a distributed system, built on top of etcd and the raft protocol.&#xA;In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover how this feature works.&#xA;Foreword:&#xA;Mgmt is a next generation configuration management project. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of it yet, or you don&amp;rsquo;t remember why we use a distributed database, start by reading the previous articles:</description>

      <title>One hour hacks: Remote LUKS over SSH</title>

      <description>I have a GNU/Linux server which I mount a few LUKS encrypted drives on. I only ever interact with the server over SSH, and I never want to keep the LUKS credentials on the remote server. I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything especially sensitive on the drives, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good security practice to encrypt it all, if only to add noise into the system and for solidarity with those who harbour much more sensitive data.</description>

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you about the recently released &amp;ldquo;automatic grouping&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;AutoGroup&amp;rdquo; feature in mgmt, a next generation configuration management prototype. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t already familiar with mgmt, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend you start by reading the introductory post, and the second post. There&amp;rsquo;s also an introductory video.&#xA;Resources in a graph&#xA;Most configuration management systems use something called a directed acyclic graph, or DAG. This is a fancy way of saying that it is a bunch of circles (vertices) which are connected with arrows (edges).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been two months since I announced mgmt, and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to continue the story by telling you more about the design of what&amp;rsquo;s now in git master. Before I get into those details, let me quickly recap what&amp;rsquo;s happened since then.&#xA;Mgmt community recap:&#xA;I gave the first public presentation about mgmt at CfgMgmtCamp. I repeated the talk at DevConf.cz. The video recording is available. Felix wrote about his work cross compiling puppet code to mgmt.</description>

      <description>On today&amp;rsquo;s issue of &amp;ldquo;one hour hacks&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you can stop your git drive-by&amp;rsquo;s to git master from breaking your CI tests&amp;hellip; Let&amp;rsquo;s continue!&#xA;The problem:&#xA;Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ve got a shitty one-line patch that I want to push to git master. I&amp;rsquo;m usually right, and everything tests out fine, but usually isn&amp;rsquo;t always, and then I look silly while I frantically try to fix git master on a project that I maintain.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret to the readers of this blog that I&amp;rsquo;ve been active in the configuration management space for some time. I owe most of my knowledge to what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned while working with Puppet and from other hackers working in and around various other communities.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve published, a number, of articles, in an, attempt, to push, the field, forwards, and to, share the, knowledge, that I&amp;rsquo;ve, learned, with others. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent many nights thinking about these problems, but it is not without some chagrin that I realized that the current state-of-the-art in configuration management cannot easily (or elegantly) solve all the problems for which I wish to write solutions.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re constantly clicking on all sorts of different URL&amp;rsquo;s throughout the day. These clickable links appear in webpages (including in &amp;ldquo;web apps&amp;rdquo; like gmail) in mail clients like Evolution, in terminals such as GNOME-terminal, and any other GTK+ app on your GNU/Linux desktop. I wanted to perform custom actions when arbitrary URL&amp;rsquo;s are clicked, including running certain links in separate Firefox profiles. There are a bunch of different steps you have to do to get this working, but it should be easy to follow along.</description>

      <description>The Oh-My-Vagrant project became public about one year ago and at the time it was more of a fancy template than a robust project, but 188 commits (and counting) later, it has gotten surprisingly useful and mature.&#xA;james@computer:~/code/oh-my-vagrant$ git rev-list HEAD --count 188 james@computer:~/code/oh-my-vagrant$ git log $(git log --pretty=format:%H|tail -1) commit 4faa6c89cce01c62130ef5a6d5fa0fff833da371 Author: James Shubin &amp;lt;james@shubin.ca&amp;gt; Date: Thu Aug 28 01:08:03 2014 -0400 Initial commit of vagrant-puppet-docker-template...

The same steps should work for CentOS 7+.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll first paste the commands you need to run, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what&amp;rsquo;s happening for those that are interested:&#xA;# run these commands, and then get hacking!</description>

      <description>I am definitely not an RPM expert, in fact, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid of it, but with recent tools such as COPR, and my glorious Makefile, some aspects of it have become palatable. This post will be about a recent journey I had building the most useless RPM ever.&#xA;A video of my journey building this RPM. Because of reasons, I wanted to satisfy an RPM dependency for a package that I wanted to install without rebuilding that RPM.</description>

      <description>Git submodules are actually a very beautiful thing. You might prefer the word powerful or elegant, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the point. The downside is that they are sometimes misused, so as always, use with care. I&amp;rsquo;ve used them in projects like puppet-gluster, oh-my-vagrant, and others. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with them, do a bit of reading and come back later, I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.&#xA;I recently did some work packaging Oh-My-Vagrant as RPM&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Making Oh-My-Vagrant (OMV) more developer accessible and easy to install (from a distribution package like RPM) has always been a goal, but was previously never a priority. This is all sorted out now. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; mode works, and how the RPM work was done. (I promise this will be somewhat interesting!)&#xA;Prerequisites:&#xA;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read any of the previous articles about Oh-My-Vagrant, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend you start there.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve added the ability to deploy a Kubernetes cluster with Oh-My-Vagrant (omv). I&amp;rsquo;ve also built an automated developer experience so that you can test your Kubernetes powered app in minutes. If you want to redeploy a new version, or see how your app behaves during a rolling update, you can use omv to test this out in minutes! I&amp;rsquo;ve recorded a screencast (~15 min), if you&amp;rsquo;d like to see some of this in action.</description>

      <description>The Oh-My-Vagrant (omv) project is an easy way to bootstrap a development environment. It is particularly useful for spinning up an arbitrary number of virtual machines in Vagrant without writing ruby code. For multi-machine container development, omv can be used to help this happen more naturally.&#xA;Oh-My-Vagrant can be very useful as a docker application development environment. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a quick (&amp;lt;9min) screencast demoing this topic. Please have a look:</description>

      <description>With Oh-My-Vagrant (omv) you can set up a dev environment in seconds. (Read the omv introduction if you&amp;rsquo;ve never used it before!) Since everything is defined in a single omv.yaml file, it is easy to share your cluster prototype with a friend! The one missing feature was associating code with this config file. This is now possible! Let me show you how it works&amp;hellip;&#xA;In the omv.yaml file there is an extern variable.</description>

      <description>Vagrant is a great tool for development, but Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) customers have typically been left out, because it has been impossible to get RHEL boxes! It would be extremely elegant if hackers could quickly test and prototype their code on the same OS as they&amp;rsquo;re running in production.&#xA;Secondly, when hacking on projects that have a long initial setup phase (eg: a long rpm install) it would be excellent if hackers could roll their own modified base boxes, so that certain common operations could be re-factored out into the base image.</description>

      <description>You might want to write code that can tell how many iterations have passed since some action occurred. Alternatively, you might want to know if it&amp;rsquo;s the first time a machine has run Puppet. To do these types of things, you might wish to have a monotonically increasing counter in your Puppet manifest. Since one did not exist, I set out to build one!&#xA;The code:&#xA;If you just want to try the code, and skip the ramble, you can include common::counter into your manifest.</description>

      <description>I use the Evolution mail client. It does have a few annoying bugs, but it has a plethora of great features too! Hopefully this post will inspire you to help hack on this piece of software and fix the bugs!&#xA;Mailing list etiquette:&#xA;When replying to mailing lists, it&amp;rsquo;s typically very friendly to include the email address of the person you&amp;rsquo;re replying to in the to or cc fields along with the mailing list address.</description>

      <description>Recently, when I tried to access http://slashdot.org/ in Firefox, I would see my browser title bar flash briefly to &amp;ldquo;AT&amp;amp;T GUI&amp;rdquo;, and then I would get redirected to: http://slashdot.org/cgi-bin/redirect.ha which returns slashdot&amp;rsquo;s custom error 404 page! What is going on? (Read on for answer&amp;hellip;)&#xA;Did slashdot mess up their mod_rewrite config? (Nope, works fine in a different browser...) Did my HTTPS everywhere extension go crazy? (Nope, still broken when disabled...) Are my HTTP requests being MITM-ed?</description>

      <description>I had an itch to scratch, and I wanted to get a bit more familiar with Openshift. I had used it in the past, but it was time to have another go. The app and the code are now available. Feel free to check out:&#xA;https://pdfdoc-purpleidea.rhcloud.com/ This is a simple app that takes the URL of a markdown file on GitHub, and outputs a pandoc converted PDF. I wanted to use pandoc specifically, because it produces PDF&#39;s that were beautifully created with LaTeX.</description>

This last point deserves another mention. Puppetlabs created the &#34;forge&#34; to try to provide some sort of added value to their stewardship.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a reader of my code or of this blog, it&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I hack on a lot of puppet and vagrant. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve fooled around with a bit of docker, too. I realized that the vagrant, environments I built for puppet-gluster and puppet-ipa needed to be generalized, and they needed new features too. Therefore&amp;hellip;&#xA;Introducing: Oh My Vagrant!&#xA;Oh My Vagrant is an attempt to provide an easy to use development environment so that you can be up and hacking quickly, and focusing on the real devops problems.</description>

      <description>Seagate has just publicly announced 8TB HDD&amp;rsquo;s in a 3.5&amp;quot; form factor. I decided to do some rough calculations to understand the density a bit better&amp;hellip;&#xA;Note: I have decided to ignore the distinction between Terabytes (TB) and Tebibytes (TiB), since I always work in base 2, but I hate the -bi naming conventions. Seagate is most likely announcing an 8TB HDD, which is actually smaller than a true 8TiB drive.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year, R.I.Pienaar released his brilliant data in modules hack, a few months ago, I got the chance to start implementing it in Puppet-Gluster, and today I have found the time to blog about it.&#xA;What is it?&#xA;R.I.&amp;rsquo;s hack lets you store hiera data inside a puppet module. This can have many uses including letting you throw out the nested mess that is commonly params.pp, and replace it with something file based that is elegant and hierarchical.</description>

      <description>Vagrant has become the de facto tool for devops. Faster iterations, clean environments, and less overhead. This isn&amp;rsquo;t an article about why you should use Vagrant. This is an article about how to get up and running with Vagrant on Fedora with libvirt easily!&#xA;Background:&#xA;This article is an update of my original Vagrant on Fedora with libvirt article. There is still lots of good information in that article, but this one should be easier to follow and uses updated versions of Vagrant and vagrant-libvirt.</description>

      <description>This is a quick trick for making working with git submodules more magic.&#xA;One day you might find that using git submodules is needed for your project. It&amp;rsquo;s probably not necessary for everyday hacking, but if you&amp;rsquo;re glue-ing things together, it can be quite useful. Puppet-Gluster uses this technique to easily include all the dependencies needed for a Puppet-Gluster+Vagrant automatic deployment.&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;re a good hacker, you develop things in separate feature branches.</description>

      <description>Puppet is missing a number of much-needed features. That&amp;rsquo;s the bad news. The good news is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to write some of these as modules that don&amp;rsquo;t need to change the Puppet core! This is an article about one of these features.&#xA;Posit: It&amp;rsquo;s not possible to apply all of your Puppet manifests in a single run.&#xA;I believe that this holds true for the current implementation of Puppet.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s my workflow:&#xA;Control+Alt+t (My shortcut to open a new gnome-terminal window.) cd ~/code/some_cool_hack/ # directory of some cool hack Control-Shift-t (Shortcut to open a new gnome-terminal tab.) Hack, hack, hack... The problem is that the new tab that I&#39;ve created will have a $PWD of ~, instead of keeping the $PWD of ~/code/some_cool_hack/, which is the project I&#39;m working on!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using a Lenovo X201 with 8GiB of RAM. Apart from some minor issues, I&amp;rsquo;ve been very satisfied with this laptop. It&amp;rsquo;s over four years old, and so I decided to see what&amp;rsquo;s available on the horizon. I did not buy an X240 because of the following reasons:&#xA;The X240 has only one slot for RAM and thus supports a maximum of 8GiB.&#xA;I think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty ridiculous for any successor to the X230 to support less RAM.</description>

It would have been great if good boxes already existed, and even better if it were easy to build my own.

I&amp;rsquo;ve published all of my code, so that you can use these techniques and tools too!&#xA;Status quo:&#xA;Having an NIH problem is bad for your vision, and it&amp;rsquo;s best to benefit from existing tools before creating your own.</description>

Getting your own Puppet server and the associated infrastructure running was never included &amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo;. Today, it is! (This is big news!)&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Vagrant to automatically build these GlusterFS clusters. I&amp;rsquo;ve tested this with Fedora 20, and vagrant-libvirt. This won&amp;rsquo;t work with Fedora 19 because of bz#876541. I recommend first reading my earlier articles for Vagrant and Fedora:</description>

This limitation immediately limits the usefulness of this technique, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to press on!</description>

      <description>Ironically, one of the reasons that I started writing Puppet code, was so that I could spend more time designing and building, and less time writing documentation. I suppose I&amp;rsquo;m a victim of my success, because Puppet-Gluster has grown large enough to warrant its own documentation.&#xA;So I gave in, and put together some documentation.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s available as markdown, and, also as a pdf. As before, there is an examples/ directory which you might want to use as additional reference.</description>

      <title>Iteration in Puppet</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/11/17/iteration-in-puppet/</link>

      <description>People often ask how to do iteration in Puppet. Most Puppet users have a background in imperative programming, and are already very familiar with for loops. Puppet is sometimes confusing at first, because it is actually (or technically, contains) a declarative, domain-specific language. In general, DSL&amp;rsquo;s aren&amp;rsquo;t always Turing complete, nor do they need to support loops, but this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t iterate.&#xA;Until recently, Puppet didn&amp;rsquo;t have an explicit looping construct, and it is quite possible to build complex modules without using this new construct.</description>

      <description>Hi there,&#xA;I hope you enjoyed my &amp;ldquo;Pushing Puppet (to its limit)&amp;rdquo; talk and demos from Puppet Camp D.C., LISA 2013. As requested, I&amp;rsquo;ve posted the code and slides.&#xA;Here is the code: https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-pushing&#xA;This module will require three modules as dependencies. The dependencies are:&#xA;My Puppet-Common module https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-common My Puppet-Runonce module https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-runonce My Puppet-FSM module https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-fsm Each example doesn&#39;t require all the dependencies, so if you&#39;re only interested in the FSM, you only need that module.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m here at LISA 2013 at the Gluster Community Day. I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked by Joe Brockmeier to give a little recap about what&amp;rsquo;s been going on. So here it is!&#xA;Wesley Duffee-Braun started off with a nice overview talk about GlusterFS. The great thing about his talk was that he gave a live demo, running on virtual machines, on his laptop. If you&amp;rsquo;re a new GlusterFS user, this is good exposure to help you get started.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m speaking at LISA 2013, the &amp;ldquo;Large Installation System Administration&amp;rdquo; conference. This conference runs all week in Washington. I&amp;rsquo;ll be giving two talks during the week, and attending at least one BOF.&#xA;My first talk is on Monday during the Gluster Community Day. I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking about puppet-gluster, and giving a live demo. I&amp;rsquo;ll be showing some new features too. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to talk more about puppet-gluster, or want to attend the talk, give me a shout, or sign up at the above Gluster Community Day link.</description>

      <description>Oh, hi there.&#xA;In case you&amp;rsquo;re interested, I&amp;rsquo;ve just made a first release of my puppet-shorewall module. This isn&amp;rsquo;t meant as an exhaustive shorewall module, but it does provide most of the usual functionality that most users need.&#xA;In particular, it&amp;rsquo;s the module dependency that I use for many of my other puppet modules that provide firewalling. This is probably where you&amp;rsquo;re most likely to consume it.&#xA;In general most modules just implement shorewall::rule, so if you really don&amp;rsquo;t want to use this code, you can implement that signature yourself, or not use automatic firewalling.</description>

I run irssi in a screen session on an SSH server that I manage, and I use gnome-terminal on my laptop.</description>

      <description>Short post, long command&amp;hellip;&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start showing the current git branch in my PS1. However, since I don&amp;rsquo;t want to know when I&amp;rsquo;m on master, I had to write a new PS1 that I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet seen anywhere. Add the following to your .bashrc: PS1=&amp;#39;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ &amp;#39; if [ -e /usr/share/git-core/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh ]; then . /usr/share/git-core/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh PS1=&amp;#39;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w$([ &amp;#34;$(__git_ps1 %s)&amp;#34; != &amp;#34;&amp;#34; -a &amp;#34;$(__git_ps1 %s)&amp;#34; != &amp;#34;master&amp;#34; ] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (echo -e &amp;#34; (\[33[32m\]&amp;#34;$(__git_ps1 &amp;#34;%s&amp;#34;)&amp;#34;\[33[0m\])&amp;#34;) || echo &amp;#34;&amp;#34;)\$ &amp;#39; fi</description>

      <description>In my attempt to push puppet to its limits, (for no particular reason), to develop more powerful puppet modules, to build in a distributed lock manager, and to be more dynamic, I&amp;rsquo;m now attempting to build a Finite State Machine (FSM) in puppet.&#xA;Is this a real finite state machine, and why would you do this?&#xA;Computer science professionals might not approve of the purity level, but they will hopefully appreciate the hack value.</description>

      <description>Theron Conrey writes about using:&#xA;BitTorrent Sync as Geo-Replication for Storage We got a chance to talk about this idea at Linuxcon. I&#39;m not entirely convinced there aren&#39;t some problem edge cases with this solution, but I think it will be hard to tell as long as the BitTorrent sync library is proprietary. I did come up with a special case of Theron&#39;s idea that I believe could work well. The special case uses the optimization that the synchronization (or file transferring) is unidirectional.</description>

The bathroom sink has two taps of course, but both of them are hot. The New Orleans heat is probably the cause of this.</description>

      <description>Hey there,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve done a bit of puppet-gluster hacking lately to try to squeeze some extra features and testing in before Linuxcon. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short list:&#xA;SELinux fixes to keep Dan Walsh happy :) Ping and status checks before volume creation. Now puppet-gluster will be less noisy about failures or missing executions that are due to the necessary incremental nature of puppet-gluster runs. You&#39;ll need multiple puppet runs to get a complete setup, so don&#39;t let puppet complain part way through.</description>

      <description>In response to some discussion in the gluster community, I am releasing my puppet-lsi module. It&amp;rsquo;s quite simple, but it is very useful for rebuilding machines. It could do a lot more, but I wanted to depend on the proprietary LSI tools as little as possible. Running megacli with puppet would be a very doable hack, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure enough devops out there who would use that feature.&#xA;Usage is straightforward if you like the sensible defaults:</description>

      <description>All good sysadmins know about using tail -f to follow a log file. I use this all the time to follow /var/log/messages and my gluster logs in particular. Maybe everyone already knows this, but it deserves a PSA: after a certain amount of time (~days) it seems that new messages don&amp;rsquo;t appear!&#xA;What happens by default is that tail -f follows the file descriptor, not the file name, so when your log files get rotated, the file descriptor still points to the (now renamed) file which no longer gets updates any more.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a puppet module for gluster. Both this, my puppet-gfs2 module, and other puppet clustering modules all share a common problem: How does one make sure that only certain operations happen on one node at a time?&#xA;The inelegant solutions are simple:&#xA;Specify manually (in puppet) which node the &#34;master&#34; is, and have it carry out all the special operations. Downside: Single point of failure for your distributed cluster, and you&#39;ve also written ugly asymmetrical code.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been having some strange networking issues with gluster. &amp;ldquo;Eco__&amp;rdquo; from #gluster suggested I try an up to date Intel nic driver. Here are the steps I followed to make that happen. No news yet on if that solved the problem.&#xA;Currently my system is using the igb (intel gigabit) driver. To find out what version you are running:&#xA;# modinfo -F version igb 3.2.10-k I found a newer version from the supermicro ftp site.</description>

      <description>For the last ~two or so years I&amp;rsquo;ve played and tested gluster on and off and hanging out in the awesome #gluster channel on Libera.chat. In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard, gluster was acquired by RedHat back in October 2011. This post describes my current setup. I urge you to send your comments and suggestions for improvement. I&amp;rsquo;ll update this as needed.&#xA;Hardware: Ideology: I wanted to build individual self-contained storage hosts.</description>
