      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you about the recently released &amp;ldquo;automatic grouping&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;AutoGroup&amp;rdquo; feature in mgmt, a next generation configuration management prototype. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t already familiar with mgmt, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend you start by reading the introductory post, and the second post. There&amp;rsquo;s also an introductory video.&#xA;Resources in a graph&#xA;Most configuration management systems use something called a directed acyclic graph, or DAG. This is a fancy way of saying that it is a bunch of circles (vertices) which are connected with arrows (edges).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been two months since I announced mgmt, and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to continue the story by telling you more about the design of what&amp;rsquo;s now in git master. Before I get into those details, let me quickly recap what&amp;rsquo;s happened since then.&#xA;Mgmt community recap:&#xA;I gave the first public presentation about mgmt at CfgMgmtCamp. I repeated the talk at DevConf.cz. The video recording is available. Felix wrote about his work cross compiling puppet code to mgmt.</description>

      <description>In this new crazy world of containers and immutable hosts, one might still want to run previous generation software such as Puppet on a current generation Atomic host. This article will explain how you can do that, and offer some proof of concept code.&#xA;The atomic host doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a yum or dnf command, because the software is pre-baked into a read-only /usr/ partition. To &amp;ldquo;install&amp;rdquo; (to use) additional software, it usually needs to be distributed and run as a container.</description>
