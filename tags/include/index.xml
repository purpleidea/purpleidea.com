      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a little over a year since I introduced the Mgmt Configuration Language. A lot has happened since then, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce some of the missing features that weren&amp;rsquo;t available when the language was first introduced. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already read that post, please start there and come back when you&amp;rsquo;re finished. In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll learn about classes.&#xA;Classes:&#xA;You might remember that the mgmt language called mcl has both statements, and expressions.</description>
