      <description>Recently, while operating two different remote-controlled appliances, I realized that it was high time for a discussion about declarative and imperative paradigms. Let&amp;rsquo;s start by looking at the two remotes:&#xA;Two different &#34;remotes&#34;. The one on the left operates a television, and the one on the right controls a central heating and cooling system. At first glance you will notice that one of these remotes is dark, and the other is light.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret to the readers of this blog that I&amp;rsquo;ve been active in the configuration management space for some time. I owe most of my knowledge to what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned while working with Puppet and from other hackers working in and around various other communities.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve published, a number, of articles, in an, attempt, to push, the field, forwards, and to, share the, knowledge, that I&amp;rsquo;ve, learned, with others. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent many nights thinking about these problems, but it is not without some chagrin that I realized that the current state-of-the-art in configuration management cannot easily (or elegantly) solve all the problems for which I wish to write solutions.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to push puppet to its limits, and so far I&amp;rsquo;ve succeeded. When you hit the kind of bug that forces you to hack around it, you know you are close. In any case, this isn&amp;rsquo;t about that embarrassing bug, it&amp;rsquo;s about how to set delayed actions in puppet.&#xA;Enter puppet-runonce, a module that I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished writing. It starts off with the realization that you can exec an action which also writes to a file.</description>
