      <description>I was recently asked to give a lecture for the PRELUDE series at McGill. Here was my abstract:&#xA;I don&#39;t like computers, and neither should you. We spend too much time figuring out how to talk to them, instead of having them figure out how to understand us. There&#39;s a big discontinuity between what software is providing, and the killer features we want! We&#39;re not completely lost though. There are a lot of good tools and methodologies available!</description>

      <description>Makefiles are both scary and wonderful. When both these adjectives are involved, it often makes for interesting hacking. This is likely the reason I use bash.&#xA;In any case, I digress, back to real work. I use Makefiles as a general purpose tool to launch any of a number of shell scripts which I use to maintain my code, and instead of actually having external shell scripts, I just build any necessary bash right into the Makefile.</description>
