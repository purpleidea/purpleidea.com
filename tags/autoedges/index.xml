      <description>In mgmt we have meta parameters. They are similar in concept to what you might be familiar with from other tools, except that they are more clearly defined (in a single struct) and vastly more powerful.&#xA;In mgmt, a meta parameter is a parameter which is codified entirely in the engine, and which can be used by any resource. In contrast with Puppet, require/before are considered meta parameters, whereas in mgmt, the equivalent is a graph edge, which is not a meta parameter.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been two months since I announced mgmt, and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to continue the story by telling you more about the design of what&amp;rsquo;s now in git master. Before I get into those details, let me quickly recap what&amp;rsquo;s happened since then.&#xA;Mgmt community recap:&#xA;I gave the first public presentation about mgmt at CfgMgmtCamp. I repeated the talk at DevConf.cz. The video recording is available. Felix wrote about his work cross compiling puppet code to mgmt.</description>
