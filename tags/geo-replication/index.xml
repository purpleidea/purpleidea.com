      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m here at LISA 2013 at the Gluster Community Day. I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked by Joe Brockmeier to give a little recap about what&amp;rsquo;s been going on. So here it is!&#xA;Wesley Duffee-Braun started off with a nice overview talk about GlusterFS. The great thing about his talk was that he gave a live demo, running on virtual machines, on his laptop. If you&amp;rsquo;re a new GlusterFS user, this is good exposure to help you get started.</description>

      <description>Theron Conrey writes about using:&#xA;BitTorrent Sync as Geo-Replication for Storage We got a chance to talk about this idea at Linuxcon. I&#39;m not entirely convinced there aren&#39;t some problem edge cases with this solution, but I think it will be hard to tell as long as the BitTorrent sync library is proprietary. I did come up with a special case of Theron&#39;s idea that I believe could work well. The special case uses the optimization that the synchronization (or file transferring) is unidirectional.</description>
