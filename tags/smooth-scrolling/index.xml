      <description>Fedora did a lovely job of updating me to the latest versionÂ (v. 20) of Firefox. One problem I found, was that scrolling on certain pages was quite jerky. Performance was worse (or more likely) on pages with a frameset, and pages which were long. Pages with many images made this problem worse.&#xA;It turns out that the workaround is to disable hardware acceleration:&#xA;After you&amp;rsquo;ve unchecked this box, restart Firefox, and scrolling is now considerably smoother.</description>
