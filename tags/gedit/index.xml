      <description>It was time to take the plunge and upgrade from Fedora 18 to Fedora 19. Fedora 18 was one of the worst releases ever, so I figured it could only get better. I ran my backups as usual, however this time I didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to need them, the upgrade process went off without a hitch! I used the fedup-cli process over the network. I always run these things inside of screen.</description>

      <description>I do a lot of my work in a terminal. For the unfamiliar, this might seem strange, however once you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with your shell, this is the best place to be. I don&amp;rsquo;t restrict myself to it though. I often want to spawn a file manager, or a graphical text editor. When I run nautilus, I usually see something like this:&#xA;james@computer:~/some/awesome/directory$ nautilus . Initializing nautilus-open-terminal extension Shutting down nautilus-open-terminal extension james@computer:~/some/awesome/directory$ This is useful, because I can open a file browser right where I want it, it&amp;rsquo;s annoying, because nautilus runs in that terminal until I close it.</description>

      <description>I write this technical blog for you to enjoy, and to help me remember. So where do I get all this knowledge? I figure it out! Here&amp;rsquo;s how I learned to fix a small gedit annoyance in one minute, and within the next three, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to do the same for other types of problems too. Ready? Set? Go!&#xA;I use gedit enough, that when I hack, I often end up using up more than the five allotted spaces in the &amp;ldquo;recent files&amp;rdquo; sections.</description>

      <title>Multifile mode for text editors</title>

      <description>Dear internets,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m a sysadmin/architect, which means I spend a good amount of time coding in puppet and other languages. Puppet is a great tool, however the puppet community is a bit anal strict about their style policies. I can respect this because I understand how important uniformity is when many developers are sharing code.&#xA;(On a side note, I absolutely can&amp;rsquo;t stand using spaces for indentation, but that&amp;rsquo;s another story.</description>

      <title>getting gedit to work like magic</title>

      <description>i use gnu/linux. it&amp;rsquo;s probably no secret. what is more of a secret, is that i secretly (well actually not so secretly) love using gedit for editing text. i still use vim, echo (gnu bash) and emacs (but only for org-mode).&#xA;vim is really, really great. but for day to day full-screen coding, i love working in gedit. i only have one [1] longstanding gripe, and today i believe that it is solved.</description>
