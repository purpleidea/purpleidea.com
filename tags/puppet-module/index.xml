      <description>Hey there,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve done a bit of puppet-gluster hacking lately to try to squeeze some extra features and testing in before Linuxcon. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short list:&#xA;SELinux fixes to keep Dan Walsh happy :) Ping and status checks before volume creation. Now puppet-gluster will be less noisy about failures or missing executions that are due to the necessary incremental nature of puppet-gluster runs. You&#39;ll need multiple puppet runs to get a complete setup, so don&#39;t let puppet complain part way through.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a little slow in making release announcements, so here&amp;rsquo;s some news:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve just released the third stage of my puppet-ipa module. At the moment it now supports installation, managing of hosts, and managing of services. It integrates with my puppet-nfs module to allow you to easily setup and run an NFSv4 kerberized server and client.&#xA;While we&amp;rsquo;re at it, that&amp;rsquo;s some more news: I&amp;rsquo;ve just released a puppet-nfs module to make your /etc/exports management easier.</description>

      <title>Playing with FreeIPA and puppet</title>

      <description>So I just rolled a new vm to hack around with FreeIPA. Here are some things that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across so far. I was planning on configuring LDAP, and Kerberos manually, but the included webui looks like a lovely tool to have for the data entry, user administrator type who likes to click on things. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore&amp;hellip;&#xA;/etc/hosts:&#xA;FreeIPA is choosy about how your /etc/hosts is formatted. It requires an entry that has a particular order, that is:</description>

      <title>puppet lsi hardware raid module</title>

      <description>In response to some discussion in the gluster community, I am releasing my puppet-lsi module. It&amp;rsquo;s quite simple, but it is very useful for rebuilding machines. It could do a lot more, but I wanted to depend on the proprietary LSI tools as little as possible. Running megacli with puppet would be a very doable hack, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure enough devops out there who would use that feature.&#xA;Usage is straightforward if you like the sensible defaults:</description>

      <title>puppet matlab module</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/06/04/puppet-matlab-module/</link>

      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/06/04/puppet-matlab-module/</guid>
      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t like repetitive work, and installing matlab counts doubly as so. Once I figured out the correct steps, I automated it with a puppet module. The downside is that the install takes a while because puppet needs to copy the iso locally. This is okay because I can be busy doing something else while this is happening.&#xA;Using the module is quite easy:&#xA;matlab::install { &amp;#39;R2011a&amp;#39;: iso =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;puppet://files/matlab/MATHWORKS_R2011A.iso&amp;#39;, licensekey =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;#####-#####-#####-#####&amp;#39;,Â # provide your own here licensefile =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;puppet:///files/matlab/license.</description>

      <title>puppet rsnapshot module</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/06/04/puppet-rsnapshot-module/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2013 02:29:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/06/04/puppet-rsnapshot-module/</guid>
      <description>Today I am releasing a puppet module for rsnapshot. The nice feature of this module, is that it lets you configure multiple different instances of rsnapshot, so that they could all run in parallel. Rsnapshot doesn&amp;rsquo;t support this directly, so this puppet module does the heavy lifting of separating out and managing each instance.&#xA;https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-rsnapshot&#xA;The examples/ directory should give you a hint on how to use it. For everything else, have a look at the code, or feel free to leave me a comment.</description>
