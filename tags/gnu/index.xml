      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m announcing a new type of provisioning tool. This is both the culmination of a long road, and the start of a new era. Please read on for all of the details. Feel free to skip to the relevant sections you&amp;rsquo;re interested in if you don&amp;rsquo;t want all of the background.&#xA;Ten years:&#xA;The vision for this specific tool started around ten years ago. Previously, as a sysadmin, I spent a lot of my time using a configuration management tool called puppet.</description>

      <description>Ever find yourself typing more characters than is necessary when using some annoying application or website? Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick hack around that.&#xA;Intro:&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s a magic program called xdotool written by Jordan Sissel that solves this problem. I&amp;rsquo;ve known about his excellent work for years, but only today did I learn he also wrote xdotool. It&amp;rsquo;s named as such because it tells the X server to do something for you.</description>

      <description>In an earlier post, I got USB audio working on my used, manual, 2013 Honda Civic EX. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll do the same for a Sony ZS-RS60BT boombox.&#xA;Here it is in all its used glory after a little cleaning. Background:&#xA;I decided I should get a small portable boombox to practice my dope dance moves. I currently still suck because I think I spend more time computering than out on the floor.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: I&amp;rsquo;m available for hire. Experienced at Linux/Golang/Mentoring/etc. More information below!&#xA;A drawing of me coding away. A photo of me giving a talk to a sold-out crowd. Background:&#xA;Two years ago, I left my job at Red Hat to work on mgmt config full-time. I&amp;rsquo;m still passionate about this project, and I&amp;rsquo;m proud of the progress that has been made in the last two years, but it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to explore new opportunities as well.</description>

      <title>USB Car Audio in a Civic</title>

      <description>Transportation is very important to me. My whole life I&amp;rsquo;ve never owned a car. I have gotten by with biking, public transit, and various car sharing services. Sadly, biking is incredibly dangerous and stressful, because most cars don&amp;rsquo;t respect bicycles, and in the winter it&amp;rsquo;s not very practical, the STM (public transit) offers an incredibly unreliable and unpleasant service, and Car2Go (car sharing) now requires that you use their proprietary smart phone app (you used to be able to just swipe the membership card) so I finally gave up and decided to buy a used car.</description>

      <title>Faster golang builds</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been hacking in golang since before version 1.4, and the speed at which my builds finished has been mostly trending downwards. Let&amp;rsquo;s look into the reasons and some fixes. TL;DR click-bait title: &amp;ldquo;Get 4x faster golang builds with this one trick!&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Here are the three reasons my builds got slower:&#xA;The compiler&#xA;Before version 1.5, the compiler was written in C but with that release, it moved to being pure golang.</description>

      <title>One hour hacks: Remote LUKS over SSH</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2016/04/25/one-hour-hacks-remote-luks-over-ssh/</link>

      <description>I have a GNU/Linux server which I mount a few LUKS encrypted drives on. I only ever interact with the server over SSH, and I never want to keep the LUKS credentials on the remote server. I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything especially sensitive on the drives, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good security practice to encrypt it all, if only to add noise into the system and for solidarity with those who harbour much more sensitive data.</description>
