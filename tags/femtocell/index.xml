      <description>LaForge and the fine folks at Osmocom (Sysmocom) recently had a femtocell giveaway. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to have much time to hack on things, but they were still quite generous in sending me one. It arrived, and I took some un-boxing photos for anyone who is curious.&#xA;A box arrived in the mail... Which recurses into an inner box... Inner box is box like. Finally... The unit is displayed. Here it is in all its glory.</description>
