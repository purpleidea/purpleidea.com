      <description>Want to tunnel etcd traffic over SSH? Here&amp;rsquo;s a pitfall I ran into.&#xA;The problem:&#xA;Mgmt supports tunnelling the etcd traffic over SSH. This is quite useful, because it means that for it to connect to etcd, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to open up any new ports other than 22.&#xA;You can run the agent like so:&#xA;mgmt run --ssh-url=etcd@etcdserver:22 --seeds=http://127.0.0.1:2379 --no-server --no-magic empty and it just works!&#xA;Lockdown:&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s no fun giving out more access than is really necessary, so I added this line to the etcd user account in their ~/.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been hacking in golang since before version 1.4, and the speed at which my builds finished has been mostly trending downwards. Let&amp;rsquo;s look into the reasons and some fixes. TL;DR click-bait title: &amp;ldquo;Get 4x faster golang builds with this one trick!&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Here are the three reasons my builds got slower:&#xA;The compiler&#xA;Before version 1.5, the compiler was written in C but with that release, it moved to being pure golang.</description>

      <title>Automatic clustering in mgmt</title>

      <description>In mgmt, deploying and managing your clustered config management infrastructure needs to be as automatic as the infrastructure you&amp;rsquo;re using mgmt to manage. With mgmt, instead of a centralized data store, we function as a distributed system, built on top of etcd and the raft protocol.&#xA;In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover how this feature works.&#xA;Foreword:&#xA;Mgmt is a next generation configuration management project. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of it yet, or you don&amp;rsquo;t remember why we use a distributed database, start by reading the previous articles:</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret to the readers of this blog that I&amp;rsquo;ve been active in the configuration management space for some time. I owe most of my knowledge to what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned while working with Puppet and from other hackers working in and around various other communities.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve published, a number, of articles, in an, attempt, to push, the field, forwards, and to, share the, knowledge, that I&amp;rsquo;ve, learned, with others. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent many nights thinking about these problems, but it is not without some chagrin that I realized that the current state-of-the-art in configuration management cannot easily (or elegantly) solve all the problems for which I wish to write solutions.</description>
