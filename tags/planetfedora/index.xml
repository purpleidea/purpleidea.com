      <description>I publicly released mgmt to the internet 10 years ago. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been 10 years. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about:&#xA;The new mgmt company A one-time new customer offer Unexpected wins Past failures Some history A new release And more&amp;hellip;&#xA;The company:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve officially started a company. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this for some time now, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to let you all know about it officially. As you already know (mgmt, purpleidea, etc&amp;hellip;) I&amp;rsquo;ve never been great at naming.</description>

      <title>Better git status</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2025/08/04/better-git-status/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using git status for quite a long time now. Let&amp;rsquo;s make it better.&#xA;My old aliases:&#xA;My ~/.gitconfig has had:&#xA;[alias] s = status d = diff l = log --show-signature for as long as I can remember. They&amp;rsquo;ve served me well.&#xA;The problem:&#xA;In one of my projects, I occasionally have a bunch of untracked files, particularly when I&amp;rsquo;m hacking on something new that isn&amp;rsquo;t committed yet. This may include notes, new tests, and so on.</description>

      <title>Running etcd over SSH</title>

      <description>Want to tunnel etcd traffic over SSH? Here&amp;rsquo;s a pitfall I ran into.&#xA;The problem:&#xA;Mgmt supports tunnelling the etcd traffic over SSH. This is quite useful, because it means that for it to connect to etcd, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to open up any new ports other than 22.&#xA;You can run the agent like so:&#xA;mgmt run --ssh-url=etcd@etcdserver:22 --seeds=http://127.0.0.1:2379 --no-server --no-magic empty and it just works!&#xA;Lockdown:&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s no fun giving out more access than is really necessary, so I added this line to the etcd user account in their ~/.</description>

      <title>Working around an iPXE issue</title>

      <description>iPXE is a terrific tool, but despite their very respectable documentation, it has some rough edges, and it still feels like an &amp;ldquo;in crowd&amp;rdquo; kind of thing, where you have to learn the common tricks by knowing someone.&#xA;The problem:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been building a provisioning tool in mgmt and instead of always relying on distro-specific boot images, I decided to use iPXE to handle the early boot, and have it hand-off to the kernel installer.</description>

      <title>Modules and imports in mgmt</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2024/12/03/modules-and-imports-in-mgmt/</link>

      <description>Mgmt modules are used for structuring your code across multiple files. This keeps things readable and allows for code reusability. For example, it should be easy to write a single module which can be effectively used by many different parties. To me, it never felt like code reuse was a core design objective with other tools. In mgmt it has been since the very beginning. I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of our module system, so let me introduce you to it properly.</description>

      <title>Mgmt Configuration Language: Functions</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a little while since I introduced the Mgmt Configuration Language. I originally wrote this article in 2019, and as I was working on it alongside the code for functions, when I realized that lambdas didn&amp;rsquo;t work properly. It took some time to finally solve that properly. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been working to get mgmt production ready. It&amp;rsquo;s properly useful for production now, and so it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to catch up on my documentation.</description>

      <description>I last wrote about dmesg in 2016. It has mostly not changed since then, but I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my setup slightly. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short article about what I did so that you can do it too, and so that I can remember for the next time.&#xA;Previously:&#xA;Previous I had a bash alias which looked like this:&#xA;alias dmesg=&amp;#39;dmesg --follow || dmesg&amp;#39; since some machines didn&amp;rsquo;t yet support the --follow flag.</description>

      <title>A new provisioning tool built with mgmt</title>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m announcing a new type of provisioning tool. This is both the culmination of a long road, and the start of a new era. Please read on for all of the details. Feel free to skip to the relevant sections you&amp;rsquo;re interested in if you don&amp;rsquo;t want all of the background.&#xA;Ten years:&#xA;The vision for this specific tool started around ten years ago. Previously, as a sysadmin, I spent a lot of my time using a configuration management tool called puppet.</description>

      <title>Bash $PATH filtering</title>

      <description>As most modern GNU+Linux distro users already know, you get a lot of tools included for free! Many of these may clutter up your $PATH and make bash tab completion more difficult than it has to be. Here&amp;rsquo;s a way to improve this!&#xA;A mess:&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I see when I tab-complete cd&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;:&#xA;james@computer:~$ cd cd cddb_query cd-info cd-read cd-convert cd-drive cd-it8 cdrecord cd-create-profile cd-fix-profile cdmkdir cdtmpmkdir cdda-player cd-iccdump cd-paranoia I genuinely only use three of those commands.</description>

      <description>There are three upcoming mgmtconfig events happening within the next seven days!&#xA;mgmt @ FOSDEM:&#xA;On February 3rd, I&amp;rsquo;ll be giving a talk in the golang devroom at FOSDEM. Please come early (1hr+) if you want to get a seat, usually this room is especially full. This happens in Brussels, but it should be recorded if there aren&amp;rsquo;t any technical glitches.&#xA;(I got rejected for the main track, but it&amp;rsquo;s my fault because I need to make my work more generally appealing first.</description>

      <description>If you have more than one git branch up in the air at the same time, having a system to track them and filter them is essential. Here are the stages I went through with git branch.&#xA;xkcd reminds us that we&amp;#39;re insane Prefixes:&#xA;My first tip involves using a memorable prefix. For new features I name my branches with feat/. For example feat/my-new-feature. Yes the slash and the dashes are treated like any regular character.</description>

      <title>Five minute hacks: Swapping left and right headphone audio in wireplumber</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m on Fedora 37 at the moment. My headphone audio is backwards. How do we fix it? I&amp;rsquo;ve apparently never found the right magic until now.&#xA;The Setup:&#xA;I have a crappy &amp;ldquo;couch computer&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s used for casual internet browsing and video watching. It has an analog audio out which goes to my speakers. I&amp;rsquo;d like to use headphones for when I don&amp;rsquo;t want to annoy my neighbours. I have a pair of wireless headphones that I got for free, but the battery doesn&amp;rsquo;t last longer than an hour.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably used libreoffice. You opened a document, and proceeded to insert an image into the text. It wiggles all over and never rests where you want it to.&#xA;The solution:&#xA;You most likely want the &amp;ldquo;anchor as character&amp;rdquo; option. Right-click on the newly inserted image, go to the Anchor menu item, and choose As Character. You will have to do this for each image you insert which is annoying&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Picture this. You&amp;rsquo;ve got a supermicro server. It&amp;rsquo;s got eight hot-swappable 3.5&amp;quot; HDD&amp;rsquo;s. You want to use all of those for storage, so you buy a nifty add-on that let&amp;rsquo;s you add four additional 2.5&amp;quot; SSD&amp;rsquo;s. Those are great for your OS. That&amp;rsquo;s a great way to keep your data separate. The motherboard only supports eight drives, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need an HBA for the additional four&amp;hellip; What are some catches and things you need to watch out for?</description>

      <title>Blocked select logging (deadlock finding) in golang</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing some massively concurrent code for mgmt lately. The concurrency makes it incredibly bug prone. In this case it&amp;rsquo;s usually races or deadlocks. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a new trick to make the process more pleasant.&#xA;The Problem:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m sure many of you have written some code like this before:&#xA;// just a small excerpt for { select { case &amp;lt;-someEvent: // some awesome thing happened! case &amp;lt;-ctx.Done(): return ctx.Err() } } And during debugging, you might have gotten frustrated and added some printf&amp;rsquo;s:</description>

      <title>Deadline context test cancellation in golang</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2023/02/24/deadline-context-test-cancellation-in-golang/</link>

      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2023/02/24/deadline-context-test-cancellation-in-golang/</guid>
      <description>I decided to write a fancy test harness in golang today. The test wraps a big internal engine for mgmt and at the top-level it takes a context for cancellation. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know about the context package, then you should go understand that and then come back here&amp;hellip; Don&amp;rsquo;t feel bad, I had no idea what it was about at first either!&#xA;The Problem:&#xA;I assumed there would be some way to follow a notification from the test runner down into my test to tell it when it was time to cleanup and exit early&amp;hellip; I expected that making my own ^C signal handler wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be correct, and I (incorrectly) assumed that the interface I&amp;rsquo;d be looking for would offer a golang context that I could pass into my code.</description>

      <description>Ever find yourself typing more characters than is necessary when using some annoying application or website? Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick hack around that.&#xA;Intro:&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s a magic program called xdotool written by Jordan Sissel that solves this problem. I&amp;rsquo;ve known about his excellent work for years, but only today did I learn he also wrote xdotool. It&amp;rsquo;s named as such because it tells the X server to do something for you.</description>

      <description>In an earlier post, I got USB audio working on my used, manual, 2013 Honda Civic EX. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll do the same for a Sony ZS-RS60BT boombox.&#xA;Here it is in all its used glory after a little cleaning. Background:&#xA;I decided I should get a small portable boombox to practice my dope dance moves. I currently still suck because I think I spend more time computering than out on the floor.</description>

They used to be free, but then they cut off the free tier, but left existing accounts alone, until they eventually cut all the non-payers off entirely.</description>

      <description>Transportation is very important to me. My whole life I&amp;rsquo;ve never owned a car. I have gotten by with biking, public transit, and various car sharing services. Sadly, biking is incredibly dangerous and stressful, because most cars don&amp;rsquo;t respect bicycles, and in the winter it&amp;rsquo;s not very practical, the STM (public transit) offers an incredibly unreliable and unpleasant service, and Car2Go (car sharing) now requires that you use their proprietary smart phone app (you used to be able to just swipe the membership card) so I finally gave up and decided to buy a used car.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a little over a year since I introduced the Mgmt Configuration Language. A lot has happened since then, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce some of the missing features that weren&amp;rsquo;t available when the language was first introduced. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already read that post, please start there and come back when you&amp;rsquo;re finished. In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll learn about classes.&#xA;Classes:&#xA;You might remember that the mgmt language called mcl has both statements, and expressions.</description>

      <description>In my hands is a Cisco AIR-CAP-3502-E-A-K9 that I saved from the landfill. After about eight hours of suffering, and what was surely a cancer causing dose of RF-radiation, I now know:&#xA;How to convince this access point to provide me with wifi.&#xA;Why Cisco products are probably best left in the garbage.&#xA;What follows is my setup guide and review for using a Cisco Aironet device. This guide will likely be useful with other models of Cisco devices, but use your own best judgment.</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve now heard, Red Hat is being acquired by IBM.&#xA;Reactions have ranged from:&#xA;The first two emotions everyone experienced. to:&#xA;The classic humourous response. to:&#xA;The classy response. to:&#xA;The thing we&amp;#39;re all curious about. to everything in between. If someone were to leak me a copy of the memo-list 2018-October.txt.gz mailman archive, I&amp;rsquo;d sure love to see that! (Of course I&amp;rsquo;m joking and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t actually ask anyone to do this.</description>

      <description>Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about many of the advantages of using a modern terminal and shell. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about using bash with GNOME terminal on a modern GNU/Linux distribution.&#xA;I particularly like switching between the terminal and GUI applications. It&amp;rsquo;s now even better.&#xA;Automatic Hyperlinks:&#xA;Occasionally, some program running in your shell might output what looked like a link:&#xA;gnome terminal and vte will automatically add links to text that looks like a web hyperlink or an email address They can be seen when you hover over them, and a right-click will display a useful context menu:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m old school cool. Real hackers chat on open, distributed platforms. Most technical discussion can be found on the Libera.chat IRC network. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect, but the advantages clearly outweigh the drawbacks.&#xA;Recently, I needed to join an existing large &amp;ldquo;community&amp;rdquo; on the centralized, proprietary walled garden that is the Slack network.&#xA;The Problem:&#xA;Connecting to the the Slack server requires that you use either the proprietary client or their proprietary web app.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on lots of new stuff in mgmt and I had a synchronization problem that needed solving&amp;hellip; Long story short, I built it into a piece of re-usable functionality, exactly like you might find in the sync package.

As you might already know, this can already be done with a chan struct{}.</description>

I learned a lot while writing puppet code, and while building some of my outrageous puppet hacks.</description>

      <description>Sometimes while I&amp;rsquo;m deep inside mgmt&amp;rsquo;s project directory, I want to run an operation from the Makefile which lives in the root! Unfortunately, if you do so while nested, you&amp;rsquo;ll just get:&#xA;james@computer:~/code/mgmt/resources$ make build make: *** No rule to make target &amp;#39;build&amp;#39;. Stop. The Ten Minute Solution:&#xA;I figured I&amp;rsquo;d hack out a quick solution. What I came up with looks like this:&#xA;#!/bin/bash # James Shubin, 2018 # run `make` in the first directory (or its parent recursively) that it works in MF=&amp;#39;Makefile&amp;#39;&#x9;# looks for this file, could look for others, but that&amp;#39;s silly CWD=$(pwd)&#x9;# starting here while true; do if [ -e &amp;#34;$MF&amp;#34; ]; then make $@&#x9;# run make!</description>

      <description>Mgmt has given us a lot of great features, demos, and insight into how infrastructure automation should be managed. Unfortunately it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a complete tool yet, because it was missing a crucial piece for its completeness. That all changes today with the addition of: the language.&#xA;An ideal language allows us to express easily what is useful for the programming task, and at the same time makes it difficult to write what leads to incomprehensible or incorrect programs.</description>

      <description>As you may have noticed, we recently re-licensed mgmt from the AGPL (Affero General Public License) to the regular GPL.

      <description>Recently, while operating two different remote-controlled appliances, I realized that it was high time for a discussion about declarative and imperative paradigms. Let&amp;rsquo;s start by looking at the two remotes:&#xA;Two different &#34;remotes&#34;. The one on the left operates a television, and the one on the right controls a central heating and cooling system. At first glance you will notice that one of these remotes is dark, and the other is light.</description>

      <description>LaForge and the fine folks at Osmocom (Sysmocom) recently had a femtocell giveaway. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to have much time to hack on things, but they were still quite generous in sending me one. It arrived, and I took some un-boxing photos for anyone who is curious.&#xA;A box arrived in the mail... Which recurses into an inner box... Inner box is box like. Finally... The unit is displayed.

      <title>Metaparameters in mgmt</title>

      <description>In mgmt we have meta parameters. They are similar in concept to what you might be familiar with from other tools, except that they are more clearly defined (in a single struct) and vastly more powerful.&#xA;In mgmt, a meta parameter is a parameter which is codified entirely in the engine, and which can be used by any resource. In contrast with Puppet, require/before are considered meta parameters, whereas in mgmt, the equivalent is a graph edge, which is not a meta parameter.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m old school and still rocking an old X220 laptop because I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the new ones. My battery life isn&amp;rsquo;t as great as I&amp;rsquo;d like it to be, but it gets worse when some &amp;ldquo;webapp&amp;rdquo; (which I&amp;rsquo;d much rather have as a native GTK+ app) causes Firefox to rev my CPU with their websocket (hi gmail!) poller.&#xA;This seems to happen most often on planes or when I&amp;rsquo;m disconnected from the internet.</description>

      <description>I previously published &amp;ldquo;A revisionist history of configuration management&amp;rdquo;. I meant for that to be the intro to this article, but it ended up being long enough that it deserved a separate post. I will explain Send/Recv in this article, but first a few clarifications to the aforementioned article.&#xA;Clarifications&#xA;I mentioned that my &amp;ldquo;revisionist history&amp;rdquo; was inaccurate, but I failed to mention that it was also not exhaustive! Many things were left out either because they were proprietary, niche, not well-known, of obscure design or simply for brevity.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a brand new core feature in mgmt called send/recv which I plan to show you shortly, but first I&amp;rsquo;d like to start with some background.&#xA;History&#xA;This is my historical perspective and interpretation about the last twenty years in configuration management. It&amp;rsquo;s likely inaccurate and slightly revisionist, but it should be correct enough to tell the design story that I want to share.&#xA;Sometime after people started to realize that writing bash scripts wasn&amp;rsquo;t a safe, scalable, or reusable way to automate systems, CFEngine burst onto the scene with the first real solution to this problem.</description>

      <description>Bootstrapping a cluster from your laptop, or managing machines without needing to first setup a separate config management infrastructure are both very reasonable and fundamental asks. I was particularly inspired by Ansible&amp;rsquo;s agent-less remote execution model, but never wanted to build a centralized orchestrator. I soon realized that I could have my ice cream and eat it too.&#xA;Prior knowledge&#xA;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the earlier articles about mgmt, then I recommend you start with those, and then come back here.</description>

      <description>I was stuck on a 14 hour flight last week, and to my disappointment, only one of the two headphone speakers were working. The plane&amp;rsquo;s media centre has an audio connector that looks like this:&#xA;Someone should consider probing this USB port. The hole to the left is smaller than a 3.5mm headphone jack, and designed for a proprietary headphone connector that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have, and the two holes to the right are part of a different proprietary connector which match with the cheap airline headphones to provide the left and right audio channels.</description>

      <description>In mgmt, deploying and managing your clustered config management infrastructure needs to be as automatic as the infrastructure you&amp;rsquo;re using mgmt to manage. With mgmt, instead of a centralized data store, we function as a distributed system, built on top of etcd and the raft protocol.&#xA;In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover how this feature works.&#xA;Foreword:&#xA;Mgmt is a next generation configuration management project.

      <description>I have a GNU/Linux server which I mount a few LUKS encrypted drives on. I only ever interact with the server over SSH, and I never want to keep the LUKS credentials on the remote server. I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything especially sensitive on the drives, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good security practice to encrypt it all, if only to add noise into the system and for solidarity with those who harbour much more sensitive data.</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s also an introductory video.&#xA;Resources in a graph&#xA;Most configuration management systems use something called a directed acyclic graph, or DAG. This is a fancy way of saying that it is a bunch of circles (vertices) which are connected with arrows (edges).</description>

Before I get into those details, let me quickly recap what&amp;rsquo;s happened since then.&#xA;Mgmt community recap:&#xA;I gave the first public presentation about mgmt at CfgMgmtCamp. I repeated the talk at DevConf.cz. The video recording is available. Felix wrote about his work cross compiling puppet code to mgmt.</description>

      <description>On today&amp;rsquo;s issue of &amp;ldquo;one hour hacks&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you can stop your git drive-by&amp;rsquo;s to git master from breaking your CI tests&amp;hellip; Let&amp;rsquo;s continue!&#xA;The problem:&#xA;Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ve got a shitty one-line patch that I want to push to git master. I&amp;rsquo;m usually right, and everything tests out fine, but usually isn&amp;rsquo;t always, and then I look silly while I frantically try to fix git master on a project that I maintain.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret to the readers of this blog that I&amp;rsquo;ve been active in the configuration management space for some time. I owe most of my knowledge to what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned while working with Puppet and from other hackers working in and around various other communities.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve published, a number, of articles, in an, attempt, to push, the field, forwards, and to, share the, knowledge, that I&amp;rsquo;ve, learned, with others. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent many nights thinking about these problems, but it is not without some chagrin that I realized that the current state-of-the-art in configuration management cannot easily (or elegantly) solve all the problems for which I wish to write solutions.</description>

These clickable links appear in webpages (including in &amp;ldquo;web apps&amp;rdquo; like gmail) in mail clients like Evolution, in terminals such as GNOME-terminal, and any other GTK+ app on your GNU/Linux desktop. I wanted to perform custom actions when arbitrary URL&amp;rsquo;s are clicked, including running certain links in separate Firefox profiles. There are a bunch of different steps you have to do to get this working, but it should be easy to follow along.</description>

      <description>My employer keeps paying me, which I appreciate, so it&amp;rsquo;s good to spend some time to make sure RHEL7 customers get a great developer experience! So here&amp;rsquo;s how to make vagrant, vagrant-libvirt and Oh-My-Vagrant work on RHEL 7+. The same steps should work for CentOS 7+.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll first paste the commands you need to run, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what&amp;rsquo;s happening for those that are interested:&#xA;# run these commands, and then get hacking!</description>

Because of reasons, I wanted to satisfy an RPM dependency for a package that I wanted to install without rebuilding that RPM.</description>

Since some of them have started to bite me, here&amp;rsquo;s a little post-mortem of one of the problems I was having.&#xA;After hacking and testing code all day, I made a seemingly innocuous change, and when running my program, I saw the following error:</description>

      <description>Git submodules are actually a very beautiful thing. You might prefer the word powerful or elegant, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the point. The downside is that they are sometimes misused, so as always, use with care. I&amp;rsquo;ve used them in projects like puppet-gluster, oh-my-vagrant, and others. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with them, do a bit of reading and come back later, I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.&#xA;I recently did some work packaging Oh-My-Vagrant as RPM&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Making Oh-My-Vagrant (OMV) more developer accessible and easy to install (from a distribution package like RPM) has always been a goal, but was previously never a priority. This is all sorted out now. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; mode works, and how the RPM work was done. (I promise this will be somewhat interesting!)&#xA;Prerequisites:&#xA;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read any of the previous articles about Oh-My-Vagrant, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend you start there.</description>

      <description>In this new crazy world of containers and immutable hosts, one might still want to run previous generation software such as Puppet on a current generation Atomic host. This article will explain how you can do that, and offer some proof of concept code.&#xA;The atomic host doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a yum or dnf command, because the software is pre-baked into a read-only /usr/ partition. To &amp;ldquo;install&amp;rdquo; (to use) additional software, it usually needs to be distributed and run as a container.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve added the ability to deploy a Kubernetes cluster with Oh-My-Vagrant (omv). I&amp;rsquo;ve also built an automated developer experience so that you can test your Kubernetes powered app in minutes. If you want to redeploy a new version, or see how your app behaves during a rolling update, you can use omv to test this out in minutes! I&amp;rsquo;ve recorded a screencast (~15 min), if you&amp;rsquo;d like to see some of this in action.</description>

      <description>The Oh-My-Vagrant (omv) project is an easy way to bootstrap a development environment. It is particularly useful for spinning up an arbitrary number of virtual machines in Vagrant without writing ruby code. For multi-machine container development, omv can be used to help this happen more naturally.&#xA;Oh-My-Vagrant can be very useful as a docker application development environment. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a quick (&amp;lt;9min) screencast demoing this topic. Please have a look:</description>

      <description>With Oh-My-Vagrant (omv) you can set up a dev environment in seconds. (Read the omv introduction if you&amp;rsquo;ve never used it before!) Since everything is defined in a single omv.yaml file, it is easy to share your cluster prototype with a friend! The one missing feature was associating code with this config file. This is now possible! Let me show you how it works&amp;hellip;&#xA;In the omv.yaml file there is an extern variable.</description>

      <description>Vagrant is a great tool for development, but Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) customers have typically been left out, because it has been impossible to get RHEL boxes! It would be extremely elegant if hackers could quickly test and prototype their code on the same OS as they&amp;rsquo;re running in production.&#xA;Secondly, when hacking on projects that have a long initial setup phase (eg: a long rpm install) it would be excellent if hackers could roll their own modified base boxes, so that certain common operations could be re-factored out into the base image.</description>

      <description>You might want to write code that can tell how many iterations have passed since some action occurred. Alternatively, you might want to know if it&amp;rsquo;s the first time a machine has run Puppet. To do these types of things, you might wish to have a monotonically increasing counter in your Puppet manifest. Since one did not exist, I set out to build one!&#xA;The code:&#xA;If you just want to try the code, and skip the ramble, you can include common::counter into your manifest.</description>

      <description>The fact that we manage the switches in our data centres differently than any other server is patently absurd, but we do so because we want to harness the power of a tiny bit of silicon which happens to be able to dramatically speed up the switching bandwidth.&#xA;beware of proprietary silicon, it&#39;s absurd! That tiny bit of silicon is known as an ASIC, or an application specific integrated circuit, and one particularly well performing ASIC (which is present in many commercially available switches) is called the Trident.</description>

I only started publicly groaning about this missing feature in 2013, and mcrha finally patched it. I tested the feature and found a small bug, mcrha patched that too, and I finally re-tested it. Now I&amp;rsquo;m blogging about this process so that you can get involved too!</description>

      <description>I usually avoid proprietary cloud services because of freedom, privacy and vendor lock-in concerns. In addition, there are some excellent libre (and hosted) services such as WordPress, Wikipedia and OpenShift which don&amp;rsquo;t have the above problems. Thirdly, there are every day Free Software tools such as Fedora GNU/Linux, Libreoffice, and git-annex-assistant which make my computing much more powerful. Finally, there are some hosted services that I use that don&amp;rsquo;t lock me in because I use them as push-only mirrors, and I only interact with them using Free Software tools.</description>

      <title>Introducing: Oh My Vagrant!</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a reader of my code or of this blog, it&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I hack on a lot of puppet and vagrant. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve fooled around with a bit of docker, too. I realized that the vagrant, environments I built for puppet-gluster and puppet-ipa needed to be generalized, and they needed new features too. Therefore&amp;hellip;&#xA;Introducing: Oh My Vagrant!&#xA;Oh My Vagrant is an attempt to provide an easy to use development environment so that you can be up and hacking quickly, and focusing on the real devops problems.</description>

      <description>Seagate has just publicly announced 8TB HDD&amp;rsquo;s in a 3.5&amp;quot; form factor. I decided to do some rough calculations to understand the density a bit better&amp;hellip;&#xA;Note: I have decided to ignore the distinction between Terabytes (TB) and Tebibytes (TiB), since I always work in base 2, but I hate the -bi naming conventions. Seagate is most likely announcing an 8TB HDD, which is actually smaller than a true 8TiB drive.</description>

      <description>(Note: this hybrid management technique is being demonstrated in the puppet-ipa module for FreeIPA, but the idea could be used for other modules and scenarios too. See below for some use cases&amp;hellip;)&#xA;The error message that puppet hackers are probably most familiar is:&#xA;Error: Duplicate declaration: Thing[/foo/bar] is already declared in file /tmp/baz.pp:2; cannot redeclare at /tmp/baz.pp:4 on node computer.example.com Typically this means that there is either a bug in your code, or someone has defined something more than once.</description>

      <description>Configuration management is an essential part of securing your infrastructure because it can make sure that it is set up correctly. It is essential that configuration management only enhance security, and not weaken it. Unfortunately, the status-quo of secret management in puppet is pretty poor.&#xA;In the worst (and most common) case, plain text passwords are found in manifests. If the module author tried harder, sometimes these password strings are pre-hashed (and sometimes salted) and fed directly into the consumer.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year, R.I.Pienaar released his brilliant data in modules hack, a few months ago, I got the chance to start implementing it in Puppet-Gluster, and today I have found the time to blog about it.&#xA;What is it?&#xA;R.I.&amp;rsquo;s hack lets you store hiera data inside a puppet module. This can have many uses including letting you throw out the nested mess that is commonly params.pp, and replace it with something file based that is elegant and hierarchical.</description>

      <description>When GNOME shell breaks, you get to keep both pieces. The nice thing about shell failures in GNOME 3, is that if you&amp;rsquo;re able to do a restart, the active windows are mostly not disturbed. The common way to do this is to type ALT-F2, r, &amp;laquo;em&amp;gt;ENTER&amp;gt;.&#xA;Unfortunately, you can&amp;rsquo;t always type that in if your shell is very borked. If you are lucky enough to have SSH access, and another machine, you can log in remotely and run this script:</description>

      <description>Vagrant has become the de facto tool for devops. Faster iterations, clean environments, and less overhead. This isn&amp;rsquo;t an article about why you should use Vagrant. This is an article about how to get up and running with Vagrant on Fedora with libvirt easily!&#xA;Background:&#xA;This article is an update of my original Vagrant on Fedora with libvirt article. There is still lots of good information in that article, but this one should be easier to follow and uses updated versions of Vagrant and vagrant-libvirt.</description>

      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2014/05/06/keeping-git-submodules-in-sync-with-your-branches/</guid>
      <description>This is a quick trick for making working with git submodules more magic.&#xA;One day you might find that using git submodules is needed for your project. It&amp;rsquo;s probably not necessary for everyday hacking, but if you&amp;rsquo;re glue-ing things together, it can be quite useful. Puppet-Gluster uses this technique to easily include all the dependencies needed for a Puppet-Gluster+Vagrant automatic deployment.&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;re a good hacker, you develop things in separate feature branches.</description>

      <description>Puppet is missing a number of much-needed features. That&amp;rsquo;s the bad news. The good news is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to write some of these as modules that don&amp;rsquo;t need to change the Puppet core! This is an article about one of these features.&#xA;Posit: It&amp;rsquo;s not possible to apply all of your Puppet manifests in a single run.&#xA;I believe that this holds true for the current implementation of Puppet.</description>

Hack, hack, hack... The problem is that the new tab that I&#39;ve created will have a $PWD of ~, instead of keeping the $PWD of ~/code/some_cool_hack/, which is the project I&#39;m working on!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using a Lenovo X201 with 8GiB of RAM. Apart from some minor issues, I&amp;rsquo;ve been very satisfied with this laptop. It&amp;rsquo;s over four years old, and so I decided to see what&amp;rsquo;s available on the horizon. I did not buy an X240 because of the following reasons:&#xA;The X240 has only one slot for RAM and thus supports a maximum of 8GiB.&#xA;I think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty ridiculous for any successor to the X230 to support less RAM.</description>

Getting your own Puppet server and the associated infrastructure running was never included &amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo;. Today, it is! (This is big news!)&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Vagrant to automatically build these GlusterFS clusters. I&amp;rsquo;ve tested this with Fedora 20, and vagrant-libvirt.

If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read through my blog yet, let me introduce myself, I&amp;rsquo;m James, and I write The Technical Blog of James.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m a sysadmin, DevOps/Puppet hacker, I.T./network architect and physiologist. Hi! I run Fedora as my primary desktop, but I also use it for servers, particularly for development before future versions of RHEL and CentOS release.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m most well-known for Puppet-Gluster, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also written a decent Puppet-IPA (FreeIPA) module.</description>

      <description>As a follow-up to my original article on recursion in Puppet, and in my attempt to Push Puppet (to its limit), I&amp;rsquo;ll now attempt some more advanced recursion techniques in Puppet.&#xA;In my original recursion example, the type does recurse, but the callee cannot return any value to the caller because it is a type, and not strictly a function. This limitation immediately limits the usefulness of this technique, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to press on!</description>

      <title>Documentation for Puppet-Gluster</title>

      <description>Ironically, one of the reasons that I started writing Puppet code, was so that I could spend more time designing and building, and less time writing documentation. I suppose I&amp;rsquo;m a victim of my success, because Puppet-Gluster has grown large enough to warrant its own documentation.&#xA;So I gave in, and put together some documentation.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s available as markdown, and, also as a pdf. As before, there is an examples/ directory which you might want to use as additional reference.</description>

      <title>Iteration in Puppet</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/11/17/iteration-in-puppet/</link>

      <description>People often ask how to do iteration in Puppet. Most Puppet users have a background in imperative programming, and are already very familiar with for loops. Puppet is sometimes confusing at first, because it is actually (or technically, contains) a declarative, domain-specific language. In general, DSL&amp;rsquo;s aren&amp;rsquo;t always Turing complete, nor do they need to support loops, but this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t iterate.&#xA;Until recently, Puppet didn&amp;rsquo;t have an explicit looping construct, and it is quite possible to build complex modules without using this new construct.</description>

      <description>Hi there,&#xA;I hope you enjoyed my &amp;ldquo;Pushing Puppet (to its limit)&amp;rdquo; talk and demos from Puppet Camp D.C., LISA 2013. As requested, I&amp;rsquo;ve posted the code and slides.&#xA;Here is the code: https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-pushing&#xA;This module will require three modules as dependencies. The dependencies are:&#xA;My Puppet-Common module https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-common My Puppet-Runonce module https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-runonce My Puppet-FSM module https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-fsm Each example doesn&#39;t require all the dependencies, so if you&#39;re only interested in the FSM, you only need that module.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m here at LISA 2013 at the Gluster Community Day. I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked by Joe Brockmeier to give a little recap about what&amp;rsquo;s been going on. So here it is!&#xA;Wesley Duffee-Braun started off with a nice overview talk about GlusterFS. The great thing about his talk was that he gave a live demo, running on virtual machines, on his laptop. If you&amp;rsquo;re a new GlusterFS user, this is good exposure to help you get started.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m speaking at LISA 2013, the &amp;ldquo;Large Installation System Administration&amp;rdquo; conference. This conference runs all week in Washington. I&amp;rsquo;ll be giving two talks during the week, and attending at least one BOF.&#xA;My first talk is on Monday during the Gluster Community Day. I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking about puppet-gluster, and giving a live demo. I&amp;rsquo;ll be showing some new features too. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to talk more about puppet-gluster, or want to attend the talk, give me a shout, or sign up at the above Gluster Community Day link.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a one minute read, about a trick which I discovered today:&#xA;When running an strace, it&amp;rsquo;s common to do something like:&#xA;strace -p&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt; Smarter hackers know that they can use some bash magic and do:&#xA;strace -p`pidof &amp;lt;process name&amp;gt;` However, if you&amp;rsquo;re tracing a script named foo.py, this won&amp;rsquo;t work because the real process is the script&amp;rsquo;s interpreter, and pidof python, might return other unrelated python scripts.&#xA;strace -p`pidof foo.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m usually on IRC, but I don&amp;rsquo;t often notice incoming pings until after the fact. I had to both write, and modify various scripts to get what I wanted, but now it&amp;rsquo;s all done, and you can benefit from my hacking by following along&amp;hellip;&#xA;The Setup&#xA;Laptop -&amp;gt; Gnome-Terminal -&amp;gt; SSH -&amp;gt; Screen -&amp;gt; Irssi This way, I&amp;rsquo;m connected to IRC, even when my laptop isn&amp;rsquo;t. I run irssi in a screen session on an SSH server that I manage, and I use gnome-terminal on my laptop.</description>

What follows is some technical commentary about stuff that went on.&#xA;JHBuild&#xA;JHBuild is a tool to make it easy to download/clone (from git) and compile all the GNOME modules and applications. It was easy to get going.</description>

      <description>Short post, long command&amp;hellip;&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start showing the current git branch in my PS1. However, since I don&amp;rsquo;t want to know when I&amp;rsquo;m on master, I had to write a new PS1 that I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet seen anywhere. Add the following to your .bashrc: PS1=&amp;#39;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ &amp;#39; if [ -e /usr/share/git-core/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh ]; then . /usr/share/git-core/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh PS1=&amp;#39;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w$([ &amp;#34;$(__git_ps1 %s)&amp;#34; != &amp;#34;&amp;#34; -a &amp;#34;$(__git_ps1 %s)&amp;#34; != &amp;#34;master&amp;#34; ] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (echo -e &amp;#34; (\[33[32m\]&amp;#34;$(__git_ps1 &amp;#34;%s&amp;#34;)&amp;#34;\[33[0m\])&amp;#34;) || echo &amp;#34;&amp;#34;)\$ &amp;#39; fi</description>

      <description>In my attempt to push puppet to its limits, (for no particular reason), to develop more powerful puppet modules, to build in a distributed lock manager, and to be more dynamic, I&amp;rsquo;m now attempting to build a Finite State Machine (FSM) in puppet.&#xA;Is this a real finite state machine, and why would you do this?&#xA;Computer science professionals might not approve of the purity level, but they will hopefully appreciate the hack value.</description>

      <description>I just realized that my Fedora 19 installation didn&amp;rsquo;t have any of the GNOME games installed by default any more. I guess there&amp;rsquo;s no love for nibbles. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick one-liner to get them all back:&#xA;$ sudo yum search game | grep gnome | awk &amp;#39;{print $1}&amp;#39; | xargs sudo yum install -y Loaded plugins: etckeeper, langpacks, refresh-packagekit Package gnome-nibbles-3.8.0-2.fc19.x86_64 already installed and latest version Resolving Dependencies --&amp;gt; Running transaction check ---&amp;gt; Package gnome-chess.</description>

      <description>It was time to take the plunge and upgrade from Fedora 18 to Fedora 19. Fedora 18 was one of the worst releases ever, so I figured it could only get better. I ran my backups as usual, however this time I didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to need them, the upgrade process went off without a hitch! I used the fedup-cli process over the network. I always run these things inside of screen.</description>

      <description>A simple hack to add a user type to my puppet-ipa module turned out to cause quite a stir. I&amp;rsquo;ve just pushed these changes out for your testing:&#xA;3 files changed, 1401 insertions(+), 215 deletions(-) You should now have a highly capable user type, along with some quick examples.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve also done a rewrite of the difference engine, so that it is cleaner and more robust. It now uses function decorators and individual function comparators to help wrangle the data into easily comparable forms.</description>

      <description>So I just rolled a new vm to hack around with FreeIPA. Here are some things that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across so far. I was planning on configuring LDAP, and Kerberos manually, but the included webui looks like a lovely tool to have for the data entry, user administrator type who likes to click on things. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore&amp;hellip;&#xA;/etc/hosts:&#xA;FreeIPA is choosy about how your /etc/hosts is formatted. It requires an entry that has a particular order, that is:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reluctantly dreading the switch to gnome 3 + shell until it&amp;rsquo;s been ironed out a little bit more than gnome 3.0 - finally took the plunge. overall it&amp;rsquo;s working well. here are some (hopefully) useful notes:&#xA;preupgrade 14-&amp;gt;17 in one step doesn&#39;t work. it lets you wait an hour for all the downloads to finish, but once you&#39;ve rebooted, the preupgrade installer tells you it can&#39;t jump this far.</description>
