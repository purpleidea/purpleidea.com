      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been afraid of RPM and package maintaining [1] for years, but thanks to Kaleb Keithley, I have finally made some RPM&amp;rsquo;s that weren&amp;rsquo;t generated from a high level tool. Now that I have the boilerplate done, it&amp;rsquo;s a relatively painless process!&#xA;In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know kkeithley, he is a wizard [2] who happens to also be especially cool and hardworking. If you meet him, be sure to buy him a $BEVERAGE.</description>
