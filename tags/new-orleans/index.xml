      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m here in New Orleans hacking up a storm and getting to meet fellow gluster users IRL. John Mark Walker started off with a great &amp;ldquo;State of the GlusterFS union&amp;rdquo; style talk.&#xA;Today Louis (semiosis) gave a great talk about running glusterfs on amazon. It was highly pragmatic and he explained how he chose the number of bricks per host. The talk will be posted online shortly.&#xA;Marco Ceppi from Canonical gave a talk about juju and gluster.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m here in New Orleans at Linux Con, hacking on puppet-gluster and talking to lots of interesting folks. I&amp;rsquo;ve met gluster hacker Theron Conrey, and my host John Mark Walker, Fedora and Raspberry Pi expertsÂ Spot and Ruth Suehle, and many others too.&#xA;The hotel is very nice. The bathroom sink has two taps of course, but both of them are hot. The New Orleans heat is probably the cause of this.</description>

      <description>John Mark Walker, (from Redhat) has been kind enough to invite me to speak at the Linuxcon Gluster Workshop in New Orleans. I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking about puppet-gluster, giving demos, and hopefully showing off some new features. I&amp;rsquo;m also looking forward to meeting up with gluster expert Joe Julian.&#xA;If there are features that puppet-gluster is missing, or you have a use case that I haven&amp;rsquo;t covered, please let me know, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to work on it for you ahead of the conference.</description>
