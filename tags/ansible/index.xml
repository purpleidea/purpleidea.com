      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a brand new core feature in mgmt called send/recv which I plan to show you shortly, but first I&amp;rsquo;d like to start with some background.&#xA;History&#xA;This is my historical perspective and interpretation about the last twenty years in configuration management. It&amp;rsquo;s likely inaccurate and slightly revisionist, but it should be correct enough to tell the design story that I want to share.&#xA;Sometime after people started to realize that writing bash scripts wasn&amp;rsquo;t a safe, scalable, or reusable way to automate systems, CFEngine burst onto the scene with the first real solution to this problem.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret to the readers of this blog that I&amp;rsquo;ve been active in the configuration management space for some time. I owe most of my knowledge to what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned while working with Puppet and from other hackers working in and around various other communities.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve published, a number, of articles, in an, attempt, to push, the field, forwards, and to, share the, knowledge, that I&amp;rsquo;ve, learned, with others. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent many nights thinking about these problems, but it is not without some chagrin that I realized that the current state-of-the-art in configuration management cannot easily (or elegantly) solve all the problems for which I wish to write solutions.</description>

      <description>With Oh-My-Vagrant (omv) you can set up a dev environment in seconds. (Read the omv introduction if you&amp;rsquo;ve never used it before!) Since everything is defined in a single omv.yaml file, it is easy to share your cluster prototype with a friend! The one missing feature was associating code with this config file. This is now possible! Let me show you how it works&amp;hellip;&#xA;In theÂ omv.yaml file there is an extern variable.</description>
