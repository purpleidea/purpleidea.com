      <title>The switch as an ordinary GNU/Linux server</title>

      <description>The fact that we manage the switches in our data centres differently than any other server is patently absurd, but we do so because we want to harness the power of a tiny bit of silicon which happens to be able to dramatically speed up the switching bandwidth.&#xA;beware of proprietary silicon, it&#39;s absurd! That tiny bit of silicon is known as an ASIC, or an application specific integrated circuit, and one particularly well performing ASIC (which is present in many commercially available switches) is called the Trident.</description>

      <title>Automatically deploying GlusterFS with Puppet-Gluster &#43; Vagrant!</title>

      <description>Puppet-Gluster was always about automating the deployment of GlusterFS. Getting your own Puppet server and the associated infrastructure running was never included &amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo;. Today, it is! (This is big news!)&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Vagrant to automatically build these GlusterFS clusters. I&amp;rsquo;ve tested this with Fedora 20, and vagrant-libvirt. This won&amp;rsquo;t work with Fedora 19 because of bz#876541. I recommend first reading my earlier articles for Vagrant and Fedora:</description>

      <title>first release of puppet-shorewall</title>

      <description>Oh, hi there.&#xA;In case you&amp;rsquo;re interested, I&amp;rsquo;ve just made a first release of my puppet-shorewall module. This isn&amp;rsquo;t meant as an exhaustive shorewall module, but it does provide most of the usual functionality that most users need.&#xA;In particular, it&amp;rsquo;s the module dependency that I use for many of my other puppet modules that provide firewalling. This is probably where you&amp;rsquo;re most likely to consume it.&#xA;In general most modules just implement shorewall::rule, so if you really don&amp;rsquo;t want to use this code, you can implement that signature yourself, or not use automatic firewalling.</description>

      <title>Linuxcon day one, Monday</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m here in New Orleans at Linux Con, hacking on puppet-gluster and talking to lots of interesting folks. I&amp;rsquo;ve met gluster hacker Theron Conrey, and my host John Mark Walker, Fedora and Raspberry Pi expertsÂ Spot and Ruth Suehle, and many others too.&#xA;The hotel is very nice. The bathroom sink has two taps of course, but both of them are hot. The New Orleans heat is probably the cause of this.</description>

      <description>In case you upgrade your CentOS 6.x box to version 6.4, the shorewall service might complain. With a scary message:&#xA;ERROR: Your kernel/iptables do not include state match support. No version of Shorewall will run on this system This is selinux at work, and the problem can easily be solved by running:&#xA;# restorecon -Rv /sbin Thanks shorewall-users and&#xA;Happy hacking,&#xA;James&#xA;You can hire James and his team at m9rx corporation.</description>
