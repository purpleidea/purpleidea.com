      <description>I publicly released mgmt to the internet 10 years ago. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been 10 years. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about:&#xA;The new mgmt company A one-time new customer offer Unexpected wins Past failures Some history A new release And more&amp;hellip;&#xA;The company:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve officially started a company. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this for some time now, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to let you all know about it officially. As you already know (mgmt, purpleidea, etc&amp;hellip;) I&amp;rsquo;ve never been great at naming.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret to the readers of this blog that I&amp;rsquo;ve been active in the configuration management space for some time. I owe most of my knowledge to what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned while working with Puppet and from other hackers working in and around various other communities.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve published, a number, of articles, in an, attempt, to push, the field, forwards, and to, share the, knowledge, that I&amp;rsquo;ve, learned, with others. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent many nights thinking about these problems, but it is not without some chagrin that I realized that the current state-of-the-art in configuration management cannot easily (or elegantly) solve all the problems for which I wish to write solutions.</description>
