      <description>Makefiles are both scary and wonderful. When both these adjectives are involved, it often makes for interesting hacking. This is likely the reason I use bash.&#xA;In any case, I digress, back to real work. I use Makefiles as a general purpose tool to launch any of a number of shell scripts which I use to maintain my code, and instead of actually having external shell scripts, I just build any necessary bash right into the Makefile.</description>

      <description>Sometimes the interfaces you need just aren&amp;rsquo;t well documented, butÂ thanks to the internets, some websearches, and a useful dictionary, you can often decipher random web documentation jargon to help you produce useful code.&#xA;You can hire James and his team at m9rx corporation.

      <description>if i&amp;rsquo;ve been silent as of late, it&amp;rsquo;s because i&amp;rsquo;ve been furiously coding away. i&amp;rsquo;ve got what i think are some elegant implementations cooking, and with any luck my extra work will pay off in hours and days and months of time saved down the road. i&amp;rsquo;ve got a few interesting (interesting with respect to your average rating of the blog posts on this site) posts cooking in my mind, and hopefully they&amp;rsquo;ll appear shortly!</description>

      <title>multi monitors and how it should all work (long babble)</title>

      <description>at work i use two screens for my day to day workflow. i find it&amp;rsquo;s much more efficient for doing work, like coding. i&amp;rsquo;ll often have at least one terminal open, a full screen text editor, and usually a number of references, such as the dbus specification open in a web browser.&#xA;i recently just realized that one of the reasons multiple monitors are so useful to me, isn&amp;rsquo;t because of the increased screen real estate (although that certaintly is an important factor) but because of how the window manager deals with the windows.</description>

      <description>hello! this blog is intended to be a place where ramblings and discoveries, by and for systems administrators and programmers can be posted and seen by many to ultimately help in the dissemination of useful findings that we wish we had been able to have read here earlier.&#xA;if that didn&amp;rsquo;t make too much sense, perhaps i could rephrase it.&#xA;You can hire James and his team at m9rx corporation.
