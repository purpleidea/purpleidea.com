      <description>Bootstrapping a cluster from your laptop, or managing machines without needing to first setup a separate config management infrastructure are both very reasonable and fundamental asks. I was particularly inspired by Ansible&amp;rsquo;s agent-less remote execution model, but never wanted to build a centralized orchestrator. I soon realized that I could have my ice cream and eat it too.&#xA;Prior knowledge&#xA;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the earlier articles about mgmt, then I recommend you start with those, and then come back here.</description>

      <title>Making an empty RPM</title>

      <description>I am definitely not an RPM expert, in fact, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid of it, but with recent tools such as COPR, and my glorious Makefile, some aspects of it have become palatable. This post will be about a recent journey I had building the most useless RPM ever.&#xA;A video of my journey building this RPM. Because of reasons, I wanted to satisfy an RPM dependency for a package that I wanted to install without rebuilding that RPM.</description>

      <title>adding range support to python&#39;s http server to kickstart with anaconda</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on automatic installs using kickstart and puppet. I&amp;rsquo;m using a modified python httpserver because it&amp;rsquo;s lightweight, and easy to integrate into my existing python code base. The server was churning away perfectly until anaconda started downloading the full rpm&amp;rsquo;s for installation. What was going wrong?&#xA;Traceback (most recent call last): [...] error: [Errno 32] Broken pipe BorkedError: See TTBOJ for explanation and discussion As it turns out, anaconda first downloads the headers, and then later requests the full rpm with an http range request.</description>

      <title>A quick anaconda trick</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/03/04/a-quick-anaconda-trick/</link>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick anaconda solution that I am now using in some of my kickstart files&amp;hellip;&#xA;I wanted to bootstrap a machine and do all the partitioning and logical volume creation, but not format or mount one of the logical volumes. The magic parameter I needed was:&#xA;--fstype=none This seems to work perfectly for me. It&amp;rsquo;s not 100% intuitive to me, but it does work. I hope it&amp;rsquo;s not an accidental bug in the anaconda code!</description>
