      <description>at work i use two screens for my day to day workflow. i find it&amp;rsquo;s much more efficient for doing work, like coding. i&amp;rsquo;ll often have at least one terminal open, a full screen text editor, and usually a number of references, such as the dbus specification open in a web browser.&#xA;i recently just realized that one of the reasons multiple monitors are so useful to me, isn&amp;rsquo;t because of the increased screen real estate (although that certaintly is an important factor) but because of how the window manager deals with the windows.</description>
