      <description>Puppet is missing a number of much-needed features. That&amp;rsquo;s the bad news. The good news is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to write some of these as modules that don&amp;rsquo;t need to change the Puppet core! This is an article about one of these features.&#xA;Posit: It&amp;rsquo;s not possible to apply all of your Puppet manifests in a single run.&#xA;I believe that this holds true for the current implementation of Puppet.</description>

      <description>In my attempt to push puppet to its limits, (for no particular reason), to develop more powerful puppet modules, to build in a distributed lock manager, and to be more dynamic, I&amp;rsquo;m now attempting to build a Finite State Machine (FSM) in puppet.&#xA;Is this a real finite state machine, and why would you do this?&#xA;Computer science professionals might not approve of the purity level, but they will hopefully appreciate the hack value.</description>
