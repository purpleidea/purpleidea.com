      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m announcing a new type of provisioning tool. This is both the culmination of a long road, and the start of a new era. Please read on for all of the details. Feel free to skip to the relevant sections you&amp;rsquo;re interested in if you don&amp;rsquo;t want all of the background.&#xA;Ten years:&#xA;The vision for this specific tool started around ten years ago. Previously, as a sysadmin, I spent a lot of my time using a configuration management tool called puppet.</description>

      <description>In my hands is a Cisco AIR-CAP-3502-E-A-K9 that I saved from the landfill. After about eight hours of suffering, and what was surely a cancer causing dose of RF-radiation, I now know:&#xA;How to convince this access point to provide me with wifi.&#xA;Why Cisco products are probably best left in the garbage.&#xA;What follows is my setup guide and review for using a Cisco Aironet device. This guide will likely be useful with other models of Cisco devices, but use your own best judgment.</description>

      <description>Bootstrapping a cluster from your laptop, or managing machines without needing to first setup a separate config management infrastructure are both very reasonable and fundamental asks. I was particularly inspired by Ansible&amp;rsquo;s agent-less remote execution model, but never wanted to build a centralized orchestrator. I soon realized that I could have my ice cream and eat it too.&#xA;Prior knowledge&#xA;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the earlier articles about mgmt, then I recommend you start with those, and then come back here.</description>
