      <description>There are three upcoming mgmtconfig events happening within the next seven days!&#xA;mgmt @ FOSDEM:&#xA;On February 3rd, I&amp;rsquo;ll be giving a talk in the golang devroom at FOSDEM. Please come early (1hr+) if you want to get a seat, usually this room is especially full. This happens in Brussels, but it should be recorded if there aren&amp;rsquo;t any technical glitches.&#xA;(I got rejected for the main track, but it&amp;rsquo;s my fault because I need to make my work more generally appealing first.</description>

      <description>mgmt @ FOSDEM:&#xA;Later today I&amp;rsquo;m giving four talks about mgmt at FOSDEM. I&amp;rsquo;m also giving two more on the following day. (One is a 5 min lightning talk.) I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I got accepted for so many talks, I just replied to the CFP for every room where I thought I had something interesting to share, and well, here we are!&#xA;I got rejected for the main track again, but I guess it&amp;rsquo;s up to me to make my work more generally appealing first.</description>
