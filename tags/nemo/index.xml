      <description>I do a lot of my work in a terminal. For the unfamiliar, this might seem strange, however once you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with your shell, this is the best place to be. I don&amp;rsquo;t restrict myself to it though. I often want to spawn a file manager, or a graphical text editor. When I run nautilus, I usually see something like this:&#xA;james@computer:~/some/awesome/directory$ nautilus . Initializing nautilus-open-terminal extension Shutting down nautilus-open-terminal extension james@computer:~/some/awesome/directory$ This is useful, because I can open a file browser right where I want it, it&amp;rsquo;s annoying, because nautilus runs in that terminal until I close it.</description>

      <description>I love GNOME and Fedora, but &amp;ldquo;upgrading&amp;rdquo; from Fedora 17 to 18 did not go well for me. I recommend you wait until either these are all fixed, or Fedora 19+ suits your needs. Here are a list of problems I had, and some workarounds. Hopefully proper patches to these bugs will get merged quickly, so that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to use these fixes.&#xA;Problem: Boot fails after upgrade from Fedora 17 to Fedora 18.</description>
