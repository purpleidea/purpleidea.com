      <description>Making Oh-My-Vagrant (OMV) more developer accessible and easy to install (from a distribution package like RPM) has always been a goal, but was previously never a priority. This is all sorted out now. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; mode works, and how the RPM work was done. (I promise this will be somewhat interesting!)&#xA;Prerequisites:&#xA;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read any of the previous articles about Oh-My-Vagrant, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend you start there.</description>

      <description>I decided to record some screencasts to show how easy it is to deploy GlusterFS using Puppet-Gluster+Vagrant. You can follow along even if you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about Puppet or Vagrant. The hardest part of this process was producing the actual videos!&#xA;If recommend first reading my earlier articles if you&amp;rsquo;re planning on following along:&#xA;Vagrant on Fedora with libvirt Vagrant vsftp and other tricks Vagrant clustered SSH and &#39;screen&#39; Automatically deploying GlusterFS with Puppet-Gluster + Vagrant!</description>

      <description>Puppet-Gluster was always about automating the deployment of GlusterFS. Getting your own Puppet server and the associated infrastructure running was never included &amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo;. Today, it is! (This is big news!)&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Vagrant to automatically build these GlusterFS clusters. I&amp;rsquo;ve tested this with Fedora 20, and vagrant-libvirt. This won&amp;rsquo;t work with Fedora 19 because of bz#876541. I recommend first reading my earlier articles for Vagrant and Fedora:</description>

      <title>Vagrant clustered SSH and ‘screen’</title>

      <description>Some fun updates for vagrant hackers&amp;hellip; I wanted to use the venerable clustered SSH (cssh) and screen with vagrant. I decided to expand on my vsftp script. First read:&#xA;Vagrant on Fedora with libvirt&#xA;and Vagrant vsftp and other tricks&#xA;to get up to speed on the background information. Vagrant screen:&#xA;First, a simple screen hack&amp;hellip; I often use my vssh alias to quickly ssh into a machine, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to waste time with sudo-ing to root and then running screen each time.</description>
