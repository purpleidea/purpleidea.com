      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a little slow in making release announcements, so here&amp;rsquo;s some news:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve just released the third stage of my puppet-ipa module. At the moment it now supports installation, managing of hosts, and managing of services. It integrates with my puppet-nfs module to allow you to easily setup and run an NFSv4 kerberized server and client.&#xA;While we&amp;rsquo;re at it, that&amp;rsquo;s some more news: I&amp;rsquo;ve just released a puppet-nfs module to make your /etc/exports management easier.</description>

      <description>The nostalgia of serial console servers, kvm&amp;rsquo;s and switched PDU&amp;rsquo;s is hopefully no longer visible in your server room. If not, you must definitely start playing catch up. Please forgive my ignorance, but these things might still be common for big windows shops, however if that&amp;rsquo;s the case, you&amp;rsquo;ve got an entirely different set of problems ;)&#xA;IPMI is an IP based protocol that allows you to talk directly to a little computer, usually built in to your server.</description>
