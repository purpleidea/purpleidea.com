      <description>My favourite piece of piano music is called &amp;ldquo;Dorothy&amp;rdquo; by &amp;ldquo;Seymour Smith&amp;rdquo;. My grandmother [1] used to play it to me when I was young. When she died, I asked if I could keep the piano music.&#xA;If you know anything about Seymour Smith, have a copy of any of his sheet music, or would like to send me a recording of Dorothy of any of his other music, please contact me.</description>
