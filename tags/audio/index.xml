      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m on Fedora 37 at the moment. My headphone audio is backwards. How do we fix it? I&amp;rsquo;ve apparently never found the right magic until now.&#xA;The Setup:&#xA;I have a crappy &amp;ldquo;couch computer&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s used for casual internet browsing and video watching. It has an analog audio out which goes to my speakers. I&amp;rsquo;d like to use headphones for when I don&amp;rsquo;t want to annoy my neighbours. I have a pair of wireless headphones that I got for free, but the battery doesn&amp;rsquo;t last longer than an hour.</description>

      <description>I was stuck on a 14 hour flight last week, and to my disappointment, only one of the two headphone speakers were working. The plane&amp;rsquo;s media centre has an audio connector that looks like this:&#xA;Someone should consider probing this USB port. The hole to the left is smaller than a 3.5mm headphone jack, and designed for a proprietary headphone connector that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have, and the two holes to the right are part of a different proprietary connector which match with the cheap airline headphones to provide the left and right audio channels.</description>
