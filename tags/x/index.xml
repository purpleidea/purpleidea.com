      <description>Ever find yourself typing more characters than is necessary when using some annoying application or website? Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick hack around that.&#xA;Intro:&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s a magic program called xdotool written by Jordan Sissel that solves this problem. I&amp;rsquo;ve known about his excellent work for years, but only today did I learn he also wrote xdotool. It&amp;rsquo;s named as such because it tells the X server to do something for you.</description>

      <description>Fedora did a lovely job of updating me to the latest versionÂ (v. 20) of Firefox. One problem I found, was that scrolling on certain pages was quite jerky. Performance was worse (or more likely) on pages with a frameset, and pages which were long. Pages with many images made this problem worse.&#xA;It turns out that the workaround is to disable hardware acceleration:&#xA;After you&amp;rsquo;ve unchecked this box, restart Firefox, and scrolling is now considerably smoother.</description>
