      <description>I publicly released mgmt to the internet 10 years ago. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been 10 years. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about:&#xA;The new mgmt company A one-time new customer offer Unexpected wins Past failures Some history A new release And more&amp;hellip;&#xA;The company:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve officially started a company. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this for some time now, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to let you all know about it officially. As you already know (mgmt, purpleidea, etc&amp;hellip;) I&amp;rsquo;ve never been great at naming.</description>

      <title>Better git status</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2025/08/04/better-git-status/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using git status for quite a long time now. Let&amp;rsquo;s make it better.&#xA;My old aliases:&#xA;My ~/.gitconfig has had:&#xA;[alias] s = status d = diff l = log --show-signature for as long as I can remember. They&amp;rsquo;ve served me well.&#xA;The problem:&#xA;In one of my projects, I occasionally have a bunch of untracked files, particularly when I&amp;rsquo;m hacking on something new that isn&amp;rsquo;t committed yet. This may include notes, new tests, and so on.</description>

      <title>Running etcd over SSH</title>

      <description>Want to tunnel etcd traffic over SSH? Here&amp;rsquo;s a pitfall I ran into.&#xA;The problem:&#xA;Mgmt supports tunnelling the etcd traffic over SSH. This is quite useful, because it means that for it to connect to etcd, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to open up any new ports other than 22.&#xA;You can run the agent like so:&#xA;mgmt run --ssh-url=etcd@etcdserver:22 --seeds=http://127.0.0.1:2379 --no-server --no-magic empty and it just works!&#xA;Lockdown:&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s no fun giving out more access than is really necessary, so I added this line to the etcd user account in their ~/.</description>

      <title>Working around an iPXE issue</title>

      <description>iPXE is a terrific tool, but despite their very respectable documentation, it has some rough edges, and it still feels like an &amp;ldquo;in crowd&amp;rdquo; kind of thing, where you have to learn the common tricks by knowing someone.&#xA;The problem:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been building a provisioning tool in mgmt and instead of always relying on distro-specific boot images, I decided to use iPXE to handle the early boot, and have it hand-off to the kernel installer.</description>

      <title>Modules and imports in mgmt</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2024/12/03/modules-and-imports-in-mgmt/</link>

      <description>Mgmt modules are used for structuring your code across multiple files. This keeps things readable and allows for code reusability. For example, it should be easy to write a single module which can be effectively used by many different parties. To me, it never felt like code reuse was a core design objective with other tools. In mgmt it has been since the very beginning. I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of our module system, so let me introduce you to it properly.</description>

      <title>Mgmt Configuration Language: Functions</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a little while since I introduced the Mgmt Configuration Language. I originally wrote this article in 2019, and as I was working on it alongside the code for functions, when I realized that lambdas didn&amp;rsquo;t work properly. It took some time to finally solve that properly. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been working to get mgmt production ready. It&amp;rsquo;s properly useful for production now, and so it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to catch up on my documentation.</description>

      <description>I last wrote about dmesg in 2016. It has mostly not changed since then, but I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my setup slightly. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short article about what I did so that you can do it too, and so that I can remember for the next time.&#xA;Previously:&#xA;Previous I had a bash alias which looked like this:&#xA;alias dmesg=&amp;#39;dmesg --follow || dmesg&amp;#39; since some machines didn&amp;rsquo;t yet support the --follow flag.</description>

      <title>A new provisioning tool built with mgmt</title>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m announcing a new type of provisioning tool. This is both the culmination of a long road, and the start of a new era. Please read on for all of the details. Feel free to skip to the relevant sections you&amp;rsquo;re interested in if you don&amp;rsquo;t want all of the background.&#xA;Ten years:&#xA;The vision for this specific tool started around ten years ago. Previously, as a sysadmin, I spent a lot of my time using a configuration management tool called puppet.</description>

      <title>Bash $PATH filtering</title>

      <description>As most modern GNU+Linux distro users already know, you get a lot of tools included for free! Many of these may clutter up your $PATH and make bash tab completion more difficult than it has to be. Here&amp;rsquo;s a way to improve this!&#xA;A mess:&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I see when I tab-complete cd&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;:&#xA;james@computer:~$ cd cd cddb_query cd-info cd-read cd-convert cd-drive cd-it8 cdrecord cd-create-profile cd-fix-profile cdmkdir cdtmpmkdir cdda-player cd-iccdump cd-paranoia I genuinely only use three of those commands.</description>

      <description>There are three upcoming mgmtconfig events happening within the next seven days!&#xA;mgmt @ FOSDEM:&#xA;On February 3rd, I&amp;rsquo;ll be giving a talk in the golang devroom at FOSDEM. Please come early (1hr+) if you want to get a seat, usually this room is especially full. This happens in Brussels, but it should be recorded if there aren&amp;rsquo;t any technical glitches.&#xA;(I got rejected for the main track, but it&amp;rsquo;s my fault because I need to make my work more generally appealing first.</description>

      <description>If you have more than one git branch up in the air at the same time, having a system to track them and filter them is essential. Here are the stages I went through with git branch.&#xA;xkcd reminds us that we&amp;#39;re insane Prefixes:&#xA;My first tip involves using a memorable prefix. For new features I name my branches with feat/. For example feat/my-new-feature. Yes the slash and the dashes are treated like any regular character.</description>

      <title>Five minute hacks: Swapping left and right headphone audio in wireplumber</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m on Fedora 37 at the moment. My headphone audio is backwards. How do we fix it? I&amp;rsquo;ve apparently never found the right magic until now.&#xA;The Setup:&#xA;I have a crappy &amp;ldquo;couch computer&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s used for casual internet browsing and video watching. It has an analog audio out which goes to my speakers. I&amp;rsquo;d like to use headphones for when I don&amp;rsquo;t want to annoy my neighbours. I have a pair of wireless headphones that I got for free, but the battery doesn&amp;rsquo;t last longer than an hour.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably used libreoffice. You opened a document, and proceeded to insert an image into the text. It wiggles all over and never rests where you want it to.&#xA;The solution:&#xA;You most likely want the &amp;ldquo;anchor as character&amp;rdquo; option. Right-click on the newly inserted image, go to the Anchor menu item, and choose As Character. You will have to do this for each image you insert which is annoying&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Picture this. You&amp;rsquo;ve got a supermicro server. It&amp;rsquo;s got eight hot-swappable 3.5&amp;quot; HDD&amp;rsquo;s. You want to use all of those for storage, so you buy a nifty add-on that let&amp;rsquo;s you add four additional 2.5&amp;quot; SSD&amp;rsquo;s. Those are great for your OS. That&amp;rsquo;s a great way to keep your data separate. The motherboard only supports eight drives, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need an HBA for the additional four&amp;hellip; What are some catches and things you need to watch out for?</description>

      <title>Blocked select logging (deadlock finding) in golang</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing some massively concurrent code for mgmt lately. The concurrency makes it incredibly bug prone. In this case it&amp;rsquo;s usually races or deadlocks. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a new trick to make the process more pleasant.&#xA;The Problem:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m sure many of you have written some code like this before:&#xA;// just a small excerpt for { select { case &amp;lt;-someEvent: // some awesome thing happened! case &amp;lt;-ctx.Done(): return ctx.Err() } } And during debugging, you might have gotten frustrated and added some printf&amp;rsquo;s:</description>

      <title>Deadline context test cancellation in golang</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2023/02/24/deadline-context-test-cancellation-in-golang/</link>

      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2023/02/24/deadline-context-test-cancellation-in-golang/</guid>
      <description>I decided to write a fancy test harness in golang today. The test wraps a big internal engine for mgmt and at the top-level it takes a context for cancellation. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know about the context package, then you should go understand that and then come back here&amp;hellip; Don&amp;rsquo;t feel bad, I had no idea what it was about at first either!&#xA;The Problem:&#xA;I assumed there would be some way to follow a notification from the test runner down into my test to tell it when it was time to cleanup and exit early&amp;hellip; I expected that making my own ^C signal handler wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be correct, and I (incorrectly) assumed that the interface I&amp;rsquo;d be looking for would offer a golang context that I could pass into my code.</description>

      <description>Ever find yourself typing more characters than is necessary when using some annoying application or website? Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick hack around that.&#xA;Intro:&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s a magic program called xdotool written by Jordan Sissel that solves this problem. I&amp;rsquo;ve known about his excellent work for years, but only today did I learn he also wrote xdotool. It&amp;rsquo;s named as such because it tells the X server to do something for you.</description>

      <description>In an earlier post, I got USB audio working on my used, manual, 2013 Honda Civic EX. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll do the same for a Sony ZS-RS60BT boombox.&#xA;Here it is in all its used glory after a little cleaning. Background:&#xA;I decided I should get a small portable boombox to practice my dope dance moves. I currently still suck because I think I spend more time computering than out on the floor.</description>

They used to be free, but then they cut off the free tier, but left existing accounts alone, until they eventually cut all the non-payers off entirely.</description>

      <description>Transportation is very important to me. My whole life I&amp;rsquo;ve never owned a car. I have gotten by with biking, public transit, and various car sharing services. Sadly, biking is incredibly dangerous and stressful, because most cars don&amp;rsquo;t respect bicycles, and in the winter it&amp;rsquo;s not very practical, the STM (public transit) offers an incredibly unreliable and unpleasant service, and Car2Go (car sharing) now requires that you use their proprietary smart phone app (you used to be able to just swipe the membership card) so I finally gave up and decided to buy a used car.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a little over a year since I introduced the Mgmt Configuration Language. A lot has happened since then, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce some of the missing features that weren&amp;rsquo;t available when the language was first introduced. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already read that post, please start there and come back when you&amp;rsquo;re finished. In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll learn about classes.&#xA;Classes:&#xA;You might remember that the mgmt language called mcl has both statements, and expressions.</description>

      <description>In my hands is a Cisco AIR-CAP-3502-E-A-K9 that I saved from the landfill. After about eight hours of suffering, and what was surely a cancer causing dose of RF-radiation, I now know:&#xA;How to convince this access point to provide me with wifi.&#xA;Why Cisco products are probably best left in the garbage.&#xA;What follows is my setup guide and review for using a Cisco Aironet device. This guide will likely be useful with other models of Cisco devices, but use your own best judgment.</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve now heard, Red Hat is being acquired by IBM.&#xA;Reactions have ranged from:&#xA;The first two emotions everyone experienced. to:&#xA;The classic humourous response. to:&#xA;The classy response. to:&#xA;The thing we&amp;#39;re all curious about. to everything in between. If someone were to leak me a copy of the memo-list 2018-October.txt.gz mailman archive, I&amp;rsquo;d sure love to see that! (Of course I&amp;rsquo;m joking and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t actually ask anyone to do this.</description>

      <description>Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about many of the advantages of using a modern terminal and shell. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about using bash with GNOME terminal on a modern GNU/Linux distribution.&#xA;I particularly like switching between the terminal and GUI applications. It&amp;rsquo;s now even better.&#xA;Automatic Hyperlinks:&#xA;Occasionally, some program running in your shell might output what looked like a link:&#xA;gnome terminal and vte will automatically add links to text that looks like a web hyperlink or an email address They can be seen when you hover over them, and a right-click will display a useful context menu:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m old school cool. Real hackers chat on open, distributed platforms. Most technical discussion can be found on the Libera.chat IRC network. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect, but the advantages clearly outweigh the drawbacks.&#xA;Recently, I needed to join an existing large &amp;ldquo;community&amp;rdquo; on the centralized, proprietary walled garden that is the Slack network.&#xA;The Problem:&#xA;Connecting to the the Slack server requires that you use either the proprietary client or their proprietary web app.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on lots of new stuff in mgmt and I had a synchronization problem that needed solving&amp;hellip; Long story short, I built it into a piece of re-usable functionality, exactly like you might find in the sync package.

As you might already know, this can already be done with a chan struct{}.</description>

I learned a lot while writing puppet code, and while building some of my outrageous puppet hacks.</description>

      <description>Sometimes while I&amp;rsquo;m deep inside mgmt&amp;rsquo;s project directory, I want to run an operation from the Makefile which lives in the root! Unfortunately, if you do so while nested, you&amp;rsquo;ll just get:&#xA;james@computer:~/code/mgmt/resources$ make build make: *** No rule to make target &amp;#39;build&amp;#39;. Stop. The Ten Minute Solution:&#xA;I figured I&amp;rsquo;d hack out a quick solution. What I came up with looks like this:&#xA;#!/bin/bash # James Shubin, 2018 # run `make` in the first directory (or its parent recursively) that it works in MF=&amp;#39;Makefile&amp;#39;&#x9;# looks for this file, could look for others, but that&amp;#39;s silly CWD=$(pwd)&#x9;# starting here while true; do if [ -e &amp;#34;$MF&amp;#34; ]; then make $@&#x9;# run make!</description>

      <description>Mgmt has given us a lot of great features, demos, and insight into how infrastructure automation should be managed. Unfortunately it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a complete tool yet, because it was missing a crucial piece for its completeness. That all changes today with the addition of: the language.&#xA;An ideal language allows us to express easily what is useful for the programming task, and at the same time makes it difficult to write what leads to incomprehensible or incorrect programs.</description>

      <description>Recently, while operating two different remote-controlled appliances, I realized that it was high time for a discussion about declarative and imperative paradigms. Let&amp;rsquo;s start by looking at the two remotes:&#xA;Two different &#34;remotes&#34;. The one on the left operates a television, and the one on the right controls a central heating and cooling system. At first glance you will notice that one of these remotes is dark, and the other is light.</description>

      <description>LaForge and the fine folks at Osmocom (Sysmocom) recently had a femtocell giveaway. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to have much time to hack on things, but they were still quite generous in sending me one. It arrived, and I took some un-boxing photos for anyone who is curious.&#xA;A box arrived in the mail... Which recurses into an inner box... Inner box is box like. Finally... The unit is displayed.

      <title>Metaparameters in mgmt</title>

      <description>In mgmt we have meta parameters. They are similar in concept to what you might be familiar with from other tools, except that they are more clearly defined (in a single struct) and vastly more powerful.&#xA;In mgmt, a meta parameter is a parameter which is codified entirely in the engine, and which can be used by any resource. In contrast with Puppet, require/before are considered meta parameters, whereas in mgmt, the equivalent is a graph edge, which is not a meta parameter.</description>

My battery life isn&amp;rsquo;t as great as I&amp;rsquo;d like it to be, but it gets worse when some &amp;ldquo;webapp&amp;rdquo; (which I&amp;rsquo;d much rather have as a native GTK+ app) causes Firefox to rev my CPU with their websocket (hi gmail!) poller.&#xA;This seems to happen most often on planes or when I&amp;rsquo;m disconnected from the internet.</description>

      <description>I previously published &amp;ldquo;A revisionist history of configuration management&amp;rdquo;. I meant for that to be the intro to this article, but it ended up being long enough that it deserved a separate post. I will explain Send/Recv in this article, but first a few clarifications to the aforementioned article.&#xA;Clarifications&#xA;I mentioned that my &amp;ldquo;revisionist history&amp;rdquo; was inaccurate, but I failed to mention that it was also not exhaustive! Many things were left out either because they were proprietary, niche, not well-known, of obscure design or simply for brevity.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a brand new core feature in mgmt called send/recv which I plan to show you shortly, but first I&amp;rsquo;d like to start with some background.&#xA;History&#xA;This is my historical perspective and interpretation about the last twenty years in configuration management. It&amp;rsquo;s likely inaccurate and slightly revisionist, but it should be correct enough to tell the design story that I want to share.&#xA;Sometime after people started to realize that writing bash scripts wasn&amp;rsquo;t a safe, scalable, or reusable way to automate systems, CFEngine burst onto the scene with the first real solution to this problem.</description>

      <description>Bootstrapping a cluster from your laptop, or managing machines without needing to first setup a separate config management infrastructure are both very reasonable and fundamental asks. I was particularly inspired by Ansible&amp;rsquo;s agent-less remote execution model, but never wanted to build a centralized orchestrator. I soon realized that I could have my ice cream and eat it too.&#xA;Prior knowledge&#xA;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the earlier articles about mgmt, then I recommend you start with those, and then come back here.</description>

      <description>I was stuck on a 14 hour flight last week, and to my disappointment, only one of the two headphone speakers were working. The plane&amp;rsquo;s media centre has an audio connector that looks like this:&#xA;Someone should consider probing this USB port. The hole to the left is smaller than a 3.5mm headphone jack, and designed for a proprietary headphone connector that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have, and the two holes to the right are part of a different proprietary connector which match with the cheap airline headphones to provide the left and right audio channels.</description>

      <description>In mgmt, deploying and managing your clustered config management infrastructure needs to be as automatic as the infrastructure you&amp;rsquo;re using mgmt to manage. With mgmt, instead of a centralized data store, we function as a distributed system, built on top of etcd and the raft protocol.&#xA;In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover how this feature works.&#xA;Foreword:&#xA;Mgmt is a next generation configuration management project. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of it yet, or you don&amp;rsquo;t remember why we use a distributed database, start by reading the previous articles:</description>

      <description>I have a GNU/Linux server which I mount a few LUKS encrypted drives on. I only ever interact with the server over SSH, and I never want to keep the LUKS credentials on the remote server. I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything especially sensitive on the drives, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good security practice to encrypt it all, if only to add noise into the system and for solidarity with those who harbour much more sensitive data.</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s also an introductory video.&#xA;Resources in a graph&#xA;Most configuration management systems use something called a directed acyclic graph, or DAG. This is a fancy way of saying that it is a bunch of circles (vertices) which are connected with arrows (edges).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been two months since I announced mgmt, and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to continue the story by telling you more about the design of what&amp;rsquo;s now in git master. Before I get into those details, let me quickly recap what&amp;rsquo;s happened since then.&#xA;Mgmt community recap:&#xA;I gave the first public presentation about mgmt at CfgMgmtCamp. I repeated the talk at DevConf.cz. The video recording is available. Felix wrote about his work cross compiling puppet code to mgmt.</description>

      <description>On today&amp;rsquo;s issue of &amp;ldquo;one hour hacks&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you can stop your git drive-by&amp;rsquo;s to git master from breaking your CI tests&amp;hellip; Let&amp;rsquo;s continue!&#xA;The problem:&#xA;Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ve got a shitty one-line patch that I want to push to git master. I&amp;rsquo;m usually right, and everything tests out fine, but usually isn&amp;rsquo;t always, and then I look silly while I frantically try to fix git master on a project that I maintain.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret to the readers of this blog that I&amp;rsquo;ve been active in the configuration management space for some time. I owe most of my knowledge to what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned while working with Puppet and from other hackers working in and around various other communities.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve published, a number, of articles, in an, attempt, to push, the field, forwards, and to, share the, knowledge, that I&amp;rsquo;ve, learned, with others. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent many nights thinking about these problems, but it is not without some chagrin that I realized that the current state-of-the-art in configuration management cannot easily (or elegantly) solve all the problems for which I wish to write solutions.</description>

      <description>Daniel P. Berrangé wrote about trying out a single node ceph cluster. I decided to take his article and turn it into an Oh-My-Vagrant omv.yaml file. It took me about two minutes to do so, and two hours to debug a problem caused by something I had broken on my laptop.&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to replicate his article in less than 5 minutes, pull down the omv.yaml file that I&amp;rsquo;ve just published and run omv up.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re constantly clicking on all sorts of different URL&amp;rsquo;s throughout the day. These clickable links appear in webpages (including in &amp;ldquo;web apps&amp;rdquo; like gmail) in mail clients like Evolution, in terminals such as GNOME-terminal, and any other GTK+ app on your GNU/Linux desktop. I wanted to perform custom actions when arbitrary URL&amp;rsquo;s are clicked, including running certain links in separate Firefox profiles. There are a bunch of different steps you have to do to get this working, but it should be easy to follow along.</description>

      <description>My employer keeps paying me, which I appreciate, so it&amp;rsquo;s good to spend some time to make sure RHEL7 customers get a great developer experience! So here&amp;rsquo;s how to make vagrant, vagrant-libvirt and Oh-My-Vagrant work on RHEL 7+. The same steps should work for CentOS 7+.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll first paste the commands you need to run, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what&amp;rsquo;s happening for those that are interested:&#xA;# run these commands, and then get hacking!</description>

Because of reasons, I wanted to satisfy an RPM dependency for a package that I wanted to install without rebuilding that RPM.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been hacking in golang for a while, but I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that I didn&amp;rsquo;t get too deep into some of the language nuances until more recently. Since some of them have started to bite me, here&amp;rsquo;s a little post-mortem of one of the problems I was having.&#xA;After hacking and testing code all day, I made a seemingly innocuous change, and when running my program, I saw the following error:</description>

      <description>Git submodules are actually a very beautiful thing. You might prefer the word powerful or elegant, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the point. The downside is that they are sometimes misused, so as always, use with care. I&amp;rsquo;ve used them in projects like puppet-gluster, oh-my-vagrant, and others. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with them, do a bit of reading and come back later, I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.&#xA;I recently did some work packaging Oh-My-Vagrant as RPM&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Making Oh-My-Vagrant (OMV) more developer accessible and easy to install (from a distribution package like RPM) has always been a goal, but was previously never a priority. This is all sorted out now. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; mode works, and how the RPM work was done. (I promise this will be somewhat interesting!)&#xA;Prerequisites:&#xA;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read any of the previous articles about Oh-My-Vagrant, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend you start there.</description>

      <description>In this new crazy world of containers and immutable hosts, one might still want to run previous generation software such as Puppet on a current generation Atomic host. This article will explain how you can do that, and offer some proof of concept code.&#xA;The atomic host doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a yum or dnf command, because the software is pre-baked into a read-only /usr/ partition. To &amp;ldquo;install&amp;rdquo; (to use) additional software, it usually needs to be distributed and run as a container.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve added the ability to deploy a Kubernetes cluster with Oh-My-Vagrant (omv). I&amp;rsquo;ve also built an automated developer experience so that you can test your Kubernetes powered app in minutes. If you want to redeploy a new version, or see how your app behaves during a rolling update, you can use omv to test this out in minutes! I&amp;rsquo;ve recorded a screencast (~15 min), if you&amp;rsquo;d like to see some of this in action.</description>

      <description>The Oh-My-Vagrant (omv) project is an easy way to bootstrap a development environment. It is particularly useful for spinning up an arbitrary number of virtual machines in Vagrant without writing ruby code. For multi-machine container development, omv can be used to help this happen more naturally.&#xA;Oh-My-Vagrant can be very useful as a docker application development environment. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a quick (&amp;lt;9min) screencast demoing this topic. Please have a look:</description>

      <description>With Oh-My-Vagrant (omv) you can set up a dev environment in seconds. (Read the omv introduction if you&amp;rsquo;ve never used it before!) Since everything is defined in a single omv.yaml file, it is easy to share your cluster prototype with a friend! The one missing feature was associating code with this config file. This is now possible! Let me show you how it works&amp;hellip;&#xA;In the omv.yaml file there is an extern variable.</description>

      <description>Vagrant is a great tool for development, but Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) customers have typically been left out, because it has been impossible to get RHEL boxes! It would be extremely elegant if hackers could quickly test and prototype their code on the same OS as they&amp;rsquo;re running in production.&#xA;Secondly, when hacking on projects that have a long initial setup phase (eg: a long rpm install) it would be excellent if hackers could roll their own modified base boxes, so that certain common operations could be re-factored out into the base image.</description>

      <description>You might want to write code that can tell how many iterations have passed since some action occurred. Alternatively, you might want to know if it&amp;rsquo;s the first time a machine has run Puppet. To do these types of things, you might wish to have a monotonically increasing counter in your Puppet manifest. Since one did not exist, I set out to build one!&#xA;The code:&#xA;If you just want to try the code, and skip the ramble, you can include common::counter into your manifest.</description>

      <description>The fact that we manage the switches in our data centres differently than any other server is patently absurd, but we do so because we want to harness the power of a tiny bit of silicon which happens to be able to dramatically speed up the switching bandwidth.&#xA;beware of proprietary silicon, it&#39;s absurd! That tiny bit of silicon is known as an ASIC, or an application specific integrated circuit, and one particularly well performing ASIC (which is present in many commercially available switches) is called the Trident.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted a feature in Evolution for a while. It was formally requested in 2002, and it just recently got fixed in git master. I only started publicly groaning about this missing feature in 2013, and mcrha finally patched it. I tested the feature and found a small bug, mcrha patched that too, and I finally re-tested it. Now I&amp;rsquo;m blogging about this process so that you can get involved too!</description>

      <description>I usually avoid proprietary cloud services because of freedom, privacy and vendor lock-in concerns. In addition, there are some excellent libre (and hosted) services such as WordPress, Wikipedia and OpenShift which don&amp;rsquo;t have the above problems. Thirdly, there are every day Free Software tools such as Fedora GNU/Linux, Libreoffice, and git-annex-assistant which make my computing much more powerful. Finally, there are some hosted services that I use that don&amp;rsquo;t lock me in because I use them as push-only mirrors, and I only interact with them using Free Software tools.</description>

      <title>Introducing: Oh My Vagrant!</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a reader of my code or of this blog, it&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I hack on a lot of puppet and vagrant. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve fooled around with a bit of docker, too. I realized that the vagrant, environments I built for puppet-gluster and puppet-ipa needed to be generalized, and they needed new features too. Therefore&amp;hellip;&#xA;Introducing: Oh My Vagrant!&#xA;Oh My Vagrant is an attempt to provide an easy to use development environment so that you can be up and hacking quickly, and focusing on the real devops problems.</description>

      <description>Seagate has just publicly announced 8TB HDD&amp;rsquo;s in a 3.5&amp;quot; form factor. I decided to do some rough calculations to understand the density a bit better&amp;hellip;&#xA;Note: I have decided to ignore the distinction between Terabytes (TB) and Tebibytes (TiB), since I always work in base 2, but I hate the -bi naming conventions. Seagate is most likely announcing an 8TB HDD, which is actually smaller than a true 8TiB drive.</description>

      <description>(Note: this hybrid management technique is being demonstrated in the puppet-ipa module for FreeIPA, but the idea could be used for other modules and scenarios too. See below for some use cases&amp;hellip;)&#xA;The error message that puppet hackers are probably most familiar is:&#xA;Error: Duplicate declaration: Thing[/foo/bar] is already declared in file /tmp/baz.pp:2; cannot redeclare at /tmp/baz.pp:4 on node computer.example.com Typically this means that there is either a bug in your code, or someone has defined something more than once.</description>

      <description>Configuration management is an essential part of securing your infrastructure because it can make sure that it is set up correctly. It is essential that configuration management only enhance security, and not weaken it. Unfortunately, the status-quo of secret management in puppet is pretty poor.&#xA;In the worst (and most common) case, plain text passwords are found in manifests. If the module author tried harder, sometimes these password strings are pre-hashed (and sometimes salted) and fed directly into the consumer.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year, R.I.Pienaar released his brilliant data in modules hack, a few months ago, I got the chance to start implementing it in Puppet-Gluster, and today I have found the time to blog about it.&#xA;What is it?&#xA;R.I.&amp;rsquo;s hack lets you store hiera data inside a puppet module. This can have many uses including letting you throw out the nested mess that is commonly params.pp, and replace it with something file based that is elegant and hierarchical.</description>

      <description>When GNOME shell breaks, you get to keep both pieces. The nice thing about shell failures in GNOME 3, is that if you&amp;rsquo;re able to do a restart, the active windows are mostly not disturbed. The common way to do this is to type ALT-F2, r, &amp;laquo;em&amp;gt;ENTER&amp;gt;.&#xA;Unfortunately, you can&amp;rsquo;t always type that in if your shell is very borked. If you are lucky enough to have SSH access, and another machine, you can log in remotely and run this script:</description>

      <description>Vagrant has become the de facto tool for devops. Faster iterations, clean environments, and less overhead. This isn&amp;rsquo;t an article about why you should use Vagrant. This is an article about how to get up and running with Vagrant on Fedora with libvirt easily!&#xA;Background:&#xA;This article is an update of my original Vagrant on Fedora with libvirt article. There is still lots of good information in that article, but this one should be easier to follow and uses updated versions of Vagrant and vagrant-libvirt.</description>

      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2014/05/06/keeping-git-submodules-in-sync-with-your-branches/</guid>
      <description>This is a quick trick for making working with git submodules more magic.&#xA;One day you might find that using git submodules is needed for your project. It&amp;rsquo;s probably not necessary for everyday hacking, but if you&amp;rsquo;re glue-ing things together, it can be quite useful. Puppet-Gluster uses this technique to easily include all the dependencies needed for a Puppet-Gluster+Vagrant automatic deployment.&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;re a good hacker, you develop things in separate feature branches.</description>

      <description>Puppet is missing a number of much-needed features. That&amp;rsquo;s the bad news. The good news is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to write some of these as modules that don&amp;rsquo;t need to change the Puppet core! This is an article about one of these features.&#xA;Posit: It&amp;rsquo;s not possible to apply all of your Puppet manifests in a single run.&#xA;I believe that this holds true for the current implementation of Puppet.</description>

Hack, hack, hack... The problem is that the new tab that I&#39;ve created will have a $PWD of ~, instead of keeping the $PWD of ~/code/some_cool_hack/, which is the project I&#39;m working on!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using a Lenovo X201 with 8GiB of RAM. Apart from some minor issues, I&amp;rsquo;ve been very satisfied with this laptop. It&amp;rsquo;s over four years old, and so I decided to see what&amp;rsquo;s available on the horizon. I did not buy an X240 because of the following reasons:&#xA;The X240 has only one slot for RAM and thus supports a maximum of 8GiB.&#xA;I think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty ridiculous for any successor to the X230 to support less RAM.</description>

Getting your own Puppet server and the associated infrastructure running was never included &amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo;. Today, it is! (This is big news!)&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Vagrant to automatically build these GlusterFS clusters. I&amp;rsquo;ve tested this with Fedora 20, and vagrant-libvirt. This won&amp;rsquo;t work with Fedora 19 because of bz#876541. I recommend first reading my earlier articles for Vagrant and Fedora:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m now syndicated on the Fedora Project planet. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read through my blog yet, let me introduce myself, I&amp;rsquo;m James, and I write The Technical Blog of James.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m a sysadmin, DevOps/Puppet hacker, I.T./network architect and physiologist. Hi! I run Fedora as my primary desktop, but I also use it for servers, particularly for development before future versions of RHEL and CentOS release.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m most well-known for Puppet-Gluster, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also written a decent Puppet-IPA (FreeIPA) module.</description>

      <description>As a follow-up to my original article on recursion in Puppet, and in my attempt to Push Puppet (to its limit), I&amp;rsquo;ll now attempt some more advanced recursion techniques in Puppet.&#xA;In my original recursion example, the type does recurse, but the callee cannot return any value to the caller because it is a type, and not strictly a function. This limitation immediately limits the usefulness of this technique, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to press on!</description>

      <title>Documentation for Puppet-Gluster</title>

      <description>Ironically, one of the reasons that I started writing Puppet code, was so that I could spend more time designing and building, and less time writing documentation. I suppose I&amp;rsquo;m a victim of my success, because Puppet-Gluster has grown large enough to warrant its own documentation.&#xA;So I gave in, and put together some documentation.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s available as markdown, and, also as a pdf. As before, there is an examples/ directory which you might want to use as additional reference.</description>

      <title>Iteration in Puppet</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/11/17/iteration-in-puppet/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2013 04:25:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/11/17/iteration-in-puppet/</guid>
      <description>People often ask how to do iteration in Puppet. Most Puppet users have a background in imperative programming, and are already very familiar with for loops. Puppet is sometimes confusing at first, because it is actually (or technically, contains) a declarative, domain-specific language. In general, DSL&amp;rsquo;s aren&amp;rsquo;t always Turing complete, nor do they need to support loops, but this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t iterate.&#xA;Until recently, Puppet didn&amp;rsquo;t have an explicit looping construct, and it is quite possible to build complex modules without using this new construct.</description>

      <description>Hi there,&#xA;I hope you enjoyed my &amp;ldquo;Pushing Puppet (to its limit)&amp;rdquo; talk and demos from Puppet Camp D.C., LISA 2013. As requested, I&amp;rsquo;ve posted the code and slides.&#xA;Here is the code: https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-pushing&#xA;This module will require three modules as dependencies. The dependencies are:&#xA;My Puppet-Common module https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-common My Puppet-Runonce module https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-runonce My Puppet-FSM module https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-fsm Each example doesn&#39;t require all the dependencies, so if you&#39;re only interested in the FSM, you only need that module.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m here at LISA 2013 at the Gluster Community Day. I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked by Joe Brockmeier to give a little recap about what&amp;rsquo;s been going on. So here it is!&#xA;Wesley Duffee-Braun started off with a nice overview talk about GlusterFS. The great thing about his talk was that he gave a live demo, running on virtual machines, on his laptop. If you&amp;rsquo;re a new GlusterFS user, this is good exposure to help you get started.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m speaking at LISA 2013, the &amp;ldquo;Large Installation System Administration&amp;rdquo; conference. This conference runs all week in Washington. I&amp;rsquo;ll be giving two talks during the week, and attending at least one BOF.&#xA;My first talk is on Monday during the Gluster Community Day. I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking about puppet-gluster, and giving a live demo. I&amp;rsquo;ll be showing some new features too. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to talk more about puppet-gluster, or want to attend the talk, give me a shout, or sign up at the above Gluster Community Day link.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a one minute read, about a trick which I discovered today:&#xA;When running an strace, it&amp;rsquo;s common to do something like:&#xA;strace -p&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt; Smarter hackers know that they can use some bash magic and do:&#xA;strace -p`pidof &amp;lt;process name&amp;gt;` However, if you&amp;rsquo;re tracing a script named foo.py, this won&amp;rsquo;t work because the real process is the script&amp;rsquo;s interpreter, and pidof python, might return other unrelated python scripts.&#xA;strace -p`pidof foo.</description>

      <description>Oh, hi there.&#xA;In case you&amp;rsquo;re interested, I&amp;rsquo;ve just made a first release of my puppet-shorewall module. This isn&amp;rsquo;t meant as an exhaustive shorewall module, but it does provide most of the usual functionality that most users need.&#xA;In particular, it&amp;rsquo;s the module dependency that I use for many of my other puppet modules that provide firewalling. This is probably where you&amp;rsquo;re most likely to consume it.&#xA;In general most modules just implement shorewall::rule, so if you really don&amp;rsquo;t want to use this code, you can implement that signature yourself, or not use automatic firewalling.</description>

      <description>Short post, long command&amp;hellip;&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start showing the current git branch in my PS1. However, since I don&amp;rsquo;t want to know when I&amp;rsquo;m on master, I had to write a new PS1 that I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet seen anywhere. Add the following to your .bashrc: PS1=&amp;#39;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ &amp;#39; if [ -e /usr/share/git-core/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh ]; then . /usr/share/git-core/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh PS1=&amp;#39;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w$([ &amp;#34;$(__git_ps1 %s)&amp;#34; != &amp;#34;&amp;#34; -a &amp;#34;$(__git_ps1 %s)&amp;#34; != &amp;#34;master&amp;#34; ] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (echo -e &amp;#34; (\[33[32m\]&amp;#34;$(__git_ps1 &amp;#34;%s&amp;#34;)&amp;#34;\[33[0m\])&amp;#34;) || echo &amp;#34;&amp;#34;)\$ &amp;#39; fi</description>

      <description>Theron Conrey writes about using:&#xA;BitTorrent Sync as Geo-Replication for Storage We got a chance to talk about this idea at Linuxcon. I&#39;m not entirely convinced there aren&#39;t some problem edge cases with this solution, but I think it will be hard to tell as long as the BitTorrent sync library is proprietary. I did come up with a special case of Theron&#39;s idea that I believe could work well. The special case uses the optimization that the synchronization (or file transferring) is unidirectional.</description>

      <description>Hey there,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve done a bit of puppet-gluster hacking lately to try to squeeze some extra features and testing in before Linuxcon. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short list:&#xA;SELinux fixes to keep Dan Walsh happy :) Ping and status checks before volume creation. Now puppet-gluster will be less noisy about failures or missing executions that are due to the necessary incremental nature of puppet-gluster runs. You&#39;ll need multiple puppet runs to get a complete setup, so don&#39;t let puppet complain part way through.</description>

      <description>I love tabs, they&amp;rsquo;re so much easier to work with, but YAML doesn&amp;rsquo;t like them. I&amp;rsquo;m constantly adding them in accidentally, and puppet&amp;rsquo;s error message is a bit cryptic:&#xA;Error: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 400 on SERVER: malformed format string - %S at /etc/puppet/manifests/foo.pp:18 on node bar.example.com This happens during a puppet run, which in my case loads up YAML files. The tricky part was that the error wasn&amp;rsquo;t at all related to the foo.</description>

      <description>It was time to take the plunge and upgrade from Fedora 18 to Fedora 19. Fedora 18 was one of the worst releases ever, so I figured it could only get better. I ran my backups as usual, however this time I didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to need them, the upgrade process went off without a hitch! I used the fedup-cli process over the network. I always run these things inside of screen.</description>

      <description>A simple hack to add a user type to my puppet-ipa module turned out to cause quite a stir. I&amp;rsquo;ve just pushed these changes out for your testing:&#xA;3 files changed, 1401 insertions(+), 215 deletions(-) You should now have a highly capable user type, along with some quick examples.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve also done a rewrite of the difference engine, so that it is cleaner and more robust. It now uses function decorators and individual function comparators to help wrangle the data into easily comparable forms.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a little slow in making release announcements, so here&amp;rsquo;s some news:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve just released the third stage of my puppet-ipa module. At the moment it now supports installation, managing of hosts, and managing of services. It integrates with my puppet-nfs module to allow you to easily setup and run an NFSv4 kerberized server and client.&#xA;While we&amp;rsquo;re at it, that&amp;rsquo;s some more news: I&amp;rsquo;ve just released a puppet-nfs module to make your /etc/exports management easier.</description>

      <description>So I just rolled a new vm to hack around with FreeIPA. Here are some things that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across so far. I was planning on configuring LDAP, and Kerberos manually, but the included webui looks like a lovely tool to have for the data entry, user administrator type who likes to click on things. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore&amp;hellip;&#xA;/etc/hosts:&#xA;FreeIPA is choosy about how your /etc/hosts is formatted. It requires an entry that has a particular order, that is:</description>

      <description>In response to some discussion in the gluster community, I am releasing my puppet-lsi module. It&amp;rsquo;s quite simple, but it is very useful for rebuilding machines. It could do a lot more, but I wanted to depend on the proprietary LSI tools as little as possible. Running megacli with puppet would be a very doable hack, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure enough devops out there who would use that feature.&#xA;Usage is straightforward if you like the sensible defaults:</description>

      <description>I could probably write a long design article explaining why identical duplicate resources should be allowed [1] in puppet. If puppet is going to survive in the long-term, they will have to build in this feature. In the short-term, I will have to hack around deficiency. As luck would have it, Mr. Bode has already written part one of the hack: ensure_resource.&#xA;Why?&#xA;Suppose you have a given infrastructure with N vaguely identical nodes.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t like repetitive work, and installing matlab counts doubly as so. Once I figured out the correct steps, I automated it with a puppet module. The downside is that the install takes a while because puppet needs to copy the iso locally. This is okay because I can be busy doing something else while this is happening.&#xA;Using the module is quite easy:&#xA;matlab::install { &amp;#39;R2011a&amp;#39;: iso =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;puppet://files/matlab/MATHWORKS_R2011A.iso&amp;#39;, licensekey =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;#####-#####-#####-#####&amp;#39;, # provide your own here licensefile =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;puppet:///files/matlab/license.</description>

      <description>Today I am releasing a puppet module for rsnapshot. The nice feature of this module, is that it lets you configure multiple different instances of rsnapshot, so that they could all run in parallel. Rsnapshot doesn&amp;rsquo;t support this directly, so this puppet module does the heavy lifting of separating out and managing each instance.&#xA;https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-rsnapshot&#xA;The examples/ directory should give you a hint on how to use it. For everything else, have a look at the code, or feel free to leave me a comment.</description>

      <description>There are a handful of websites out there that decide that they know better than your browser and tell it to not offer to save passwords. They do this by setting a form autocomplete attribute to off.&#xA;Since we already agree that HTML and the web are a terrible idea, hopefully we can find a way to hack around this. It turns out that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to, because many others have solved this hack before me.</description>

      <description>This post is about a particularly elegant (and crucial) feature in puppet exported resources: attribute overriding. If you&amp;rsquo;re not already familiar with exported resources, you should start there, as they are the killer feature that makes configuration management with puppet awesome. (I haven&amp;rsquo;t found any explicit docs about this feature either, so feel free to comment if you know where they&amp;rsquo;re hidden.)&#xA;Setup: I&amp;rsquo;ve got a virtual machine which exports a resource to N different nodes.</description>

      <description>Fedora did a lovely job of updating me to the latest version (v. 20) of Firefox. One problem I found, was that scrolling on certain pages was quite jerky. Performance was worse (or more likely) on pages with a frameset, and pages which were long. Pages with many images made this problem worse.&#xA;It turns out that the workaround is to disable hardware acceleration:&#xA;After you&amp;rsquo;ve unchecked this box, restart Firefox, and scrolling is now considerably smoother.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t restrict myself to it though. I often want to spawn a file manager, or a graphical text editor. When I run nautilus, I usually see something like this:&#xA;james@computer:~/some/awesome/directory$ nautilus . Initializing nautilus-open-terminal extension Shutting down nautilus-open-terminal extension james@computer:~/some/awesome/directory$ This is useful, because I can open a file browser right where I want it, it&amp;rsquo;s annoying, because nautilus runs in that terminal until I close it.</description>

What was going wrong?&#xA;Traceback (most recent call last): [...] error: [Errno 32] Broken pipe BorkedError: See TTBOJ for explanation and discussion As it turns out, anaconda first downloads the headers, and then later requests the full rpm with an http range request.</description>

      <description>Everyone needs to send and receive files sometimes. Traditionally people send files as email attachments.

(Chrome actually does!)&#xA;Seahorse is a useful tool to browse and manage your keyrings. Each keyring is physically stored in: ~/.gnome2/keyrings/$something.keyring&#xA;Usually the &amp;ldquo;$something&amp;rdquo;, matches the name of the keyring, however the real name comes from within the file. I had an older ubuntu machine running GNOME, and I wanted to import my keyring.</description>

      <description>As you might already know, I like pushing the boundaries of what puppet is able to do. Today, I realized that I needed to include a class by variable name. A simple way to do this is possible with:&#xA;$foo = &amp;#39;world&amp;#39; class { &amp;#34;hello::${foo}::params&amp;#34;: } I then realized that you could also do this with the standard include keyword:&#xA;$foo = &amp;#39;world&amp;#39; include &amp;#34;hello::${foo}::params&amp;#34; If you&amp;rsquo;re really insane enough to need to have your include depend on a variable, then this should suit your needs.</description>

      <description>Firefox has a &amp;ldquo;new tab&amp;rdquo; speed dial type page available. I use it as my homepage (hint, use: about:newtab) and find it very useful for launching my often used favourites.&#xA;My one gripe is that it only shows you a default grid of 3 x 3. You can easily change that if you look in the secret preferences. Open a new tab and type in: about:config, accept the warning, and then search for: browser.</description>

      <title>recursion in puppet (for no particular reason)</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on some fancy puppet &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo;, and I realized recursion could be very useful. I decided to try out a little hack to see if I could get it to work. I&amp;rsquo;ll jump right into the code: #!/usr/bin/puppet define recursion( $count ) { notify { &amp;#34;count-${count}&amp;#34;: } $minus1 = inline_template(&amp;#39;&amp;lt;%= count.to_i - 1 %&amp;gt;&amp;#39;) if &amp;#34;${minus1}&amp;#34; == &amp;#39;0&amp;#39; { notify { &amp;#39;done counting!&amp;#39;: } } else { # recurse recursion { &amp;#34;count-${minus1}&amp;#34;: count =&amp;gt; $minus1, } } } # kick it off.</description>

      <title>continuous display of log files (better tail -f)</title>

      <description>All good sysadmins know about using tail -f to follow a log file. I use this all the time to follow /var/log/messages and my gluster logs in particular. Maybe everyone already knows this, but it deserves a PSA: after a certain amount of time (~days) it seems that new messages don&amp;rsquo;t appear!&#xA;What happens by default is that tail -f follows the file descriptor, not the file name, so when your log files get rotated, the file descriptor still points to the (now renamed) file which no longer gets updates any more.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to push puppet to its limits, and so far I&amp;rsquo;ve succeeded. When you hit the kind of bug that forces you to hack around it, you know you are close. In any case, this isn&amp;rsquo;t about that embarrassing bug, it&amp;rsquo;s about how to set delayed actions in puppet.&#xA;Enter puppet-runonce, a module that I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished writing. It starts off with the realization that you can exec an action which also writes to a file.</description>

      <description>I am writing a keepalived module for puppet. It will naturally be called: &amp;ldquo;puppet-keepalived&amp;rdquo;, and I will be releasing the code in the near future! In any case, if you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with VRRP, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that each managed link (eg: resource or VIP) has a common routerid and password which are shared among all members in the group. It is important that these parameters are unique across the type definitions on a single node.</description>

      <description>I love my keyboard shortcuts, and I sometimes I want to change them. If you&amp;rsquo;re ever in a gnome application and wanted to change that one right there, you can now live-edit them!&#xA;In a terminal, first enable this feature:&#xA;gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface can-change-accels true Next, hover over the menu item shortcut that you want to change. Enter the shortcut you want. It should update immediately! I like to disable this live-editing, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally change any shortcuts.</description>

      <description>Dear internets,&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m a sysadmin/architect, which means I spend a good amount of time coding in puppet and other languages. Puppet is a great tool, however the puppet community is a bit anal strict about their style policies. I can respect this because I understand how important uniformity is when many developers are sharing code.&#xA;(On a side note, I absolutely can&amp;rsquo;t stand using spaces for indentation, but that&amp;rsquo;s another story.</description>

      <description>It turns out it is non trivial (afaict) to include a tree of files (a directory) in a python distutils data_files argument. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I managed to do it, while also allowing the programmer to include manual entries: NAME = &amp;#39;project_name&amp;#39; distutils.core.setup( # ... data_files=[ (&amp;#39;share/%s&amp;#39; % NAME, [&amp;#39;README&amp;#39;]), (&amp;#39;share/%s&amp;#39; % NAME, [&amp;#39;files/somefile&amp;#39;]), (&amp;#39;share/%s/templates&amp;#39; % NAME, [ &amp;#39;files/templates/template1.tmpl&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;files/templates/template2.tmpl&amp;#39;, ]), ] + [(&amp;#39;share/%s/%s&amp;#39; % (NAME, x[0]), map(lambda y: x[0]+&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;+y, x[2])) for x in os.</description>

      <description>Good python software developers tend to use distutils and include a setup.py with their code. The problem I often encounter is finding out which prefix your software has been installed in from within the python code. This might be necessary if you want to interact with some data that you&amp;rsquo;ve installed into: $prefix/share/projectname/ Here are the various steps:&#xA;1) Distutils: NAME=&amp;#39;someproject&amp;#39; distutils.core.setup( name=NAME, version=&amp;#39;0.1&amp;#39;, author=&amp;#39;James Shubin&amp;#39;, author_email=&amp;#39;secret@purpleidea.com&amp;#39;, url=&amp;#39;https://purpleidea.com/&amp;#39;, description=&amp;#39;This is an example project&amp;#39;, # http://pypi.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a puppet module for gluster. Both this, my puppet-gfs2 module, and other puppet clustering modules all share a common problem: How does one make sure that only certain operations happen on one node at a time?&#xA;The inelegant solutions are simple:&#xA;Specify manually (in puppet) which node the &#34;master&#34; is, and have it carry out all the special operations. Downside: Single point of failure for your distributed cluster, and you&#39;ve also written ugly asymmetrical code.</description>

      <description>The thoughtful bodepd has been kind enough to help me get my puppet-gluster module off the ground and publicized a bit too. My first few commits have been all clean up to get my initial hacking up to snuff with the puppet style guidelines. Sadly, I love indenting my code with tabs, and this is against the puppet rules :(&#xA;http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TabsSpacesBoth I&amp;rsquo;ll be accepting patches by email, but I&amp;rsquo;d prefer discussion first, especially since I&amp;rsquo;ve got a few obvious things brewing in my mental queue that should hit master shortly.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been having some strange networking issues with gluster. &amp;ldquo;Eco__&amp;rdquo; from #gluster suggested I try an up to date Intel nic driver.

To find out what version you are running:&#xA;# modinfo -F version igb 3.2.10-k I found a newer version from the supermicro ftp site.</description>

      <description>So a friend of mine uses kde4 for its klipper feature. Turns out he&amp;rsquo;s right that it&amp;rsquo;s an awesome feature! I realized I couldn&amp;rsquo;t let gnome3 take second place to a clipboard app, so after a bit of searching&amp;hellip;&#xA;$ sudo yum install gnome-shell-extension-gpaste gpaste xsel Next hit up: https://extensions.gnome.org/local/ to flip on the extension. I had to first type: ALT-F2, &amp;ldquo;r&amp;rdquo; (to restart the gnome shell). Don&amp;rsquo;t worry your apps won&amp;rsquo;t die.</description>

      <description>Dear internets,&#xA;Once upon a time, I had one of those &amp;ldquo;brain teaser-of-the-day&amp;rdquo; calendars. Free business tip: someone should make an &amp;lsquo;rsync&amp;rsquo; version. That would be brilliant. (If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what rsync is, then you should probably go read a different blog.)&#xA;Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s used kvm might know, linux virtual machines can have sparse .raw file backing stores. This means the operating system could think it has one TiB of space, when it is actually sharing a one TiB physical harddrive with many others.</description>

      <description>I was recently asked to give a lecture for the PRELUDE series at McGill. Here was my abstract:&#xA;I don&#39;t like computers, and neither should you. We spend too much time figuring out how to talk to them, instead of having them figure out how to understand us. There&#39;s a big discontinuity between what software is providing, and the killer features we want! We&#39;re not completely lost though. There are a lot of good tools and methodologies available!</description>

      <description>Makefiles are both scary and wonderful. When both these adjectives are involved, it often makes for interesting hacking. This is likely the reason I use bash.&#xA;In any case, I digress, back to real work. I use Makefiles as a general purpose tool to launch any of a number of shell scripts which I use to maintain my code, and instead of actually having external shell scripts, I just build any necessary bash right into the Makefile.</description>

      <description>i use gnu/linux. it&amp;rsquo;s probably no secret. what is more of a secret, is that i secretly (well actually not so secretly) love using gedit for editing text. i still use vim, echo (gnu bash) and emacs (but only for org-mode).&#xA;vim is really, really great. but for day to day full-screen coding, i love working in gedit. i only have one [1] longstanding gripe, and today i believe that it is solved.</description>

      <description>since i do much research on the internets, i often find myself in a web browser. my favourite of the lot is epiphany. this post isn&amp;rsquo;t about its merits or failures, but about the awesome way to make my location bar be exactly how i like it: monospaced.&#xA;just add the following into your ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file and then restart epiphany. feel free to modify as you wish.&#xA;# ~/.gtkrc-2.0 style &amp;#34;Epiphany_Locationbar&amp;#34; { # leave out the font size if you wish font_name = &amp;#34;Monospace 12&amp;#34; #bg[NORMAL] = &amp;#34;#ff0000&amp;#34; } # both of these seem to work.</description>

      <description>sooner or later you&amp;rsquo;ll end up needing to do some argument parsing. the foolish end up writing their own yucky parser that ends up having a big if statement filled with things like:&#xA;if len(sys.argv) &amp;gt; 1&#xA;in it. don&amp;rsquo;t do this unless you have a really good excuse.&#xA;sooner or later, someone directs you to getopt, and you happily continue on with buggy manual parsing thinking you&amp;rsquo;ve &amp;ldquo;found the way&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>at work i use two screens for my day to day workflow. i find it&amp;rsquo;s much more efficient for doing work, like coding. i&amp;rsquo;ll often have at least one terminal open, a full screen text editor, and usually a number of references, such as the dbus specification open in a web browser.&#xA;i recently just realized that one of the reasons multiple monitors are so useful to me, isn&amp;rsquo;t because of the increased screen real estate (although that certaintly is an important factor) but because of how the window manager deals with the windows.</description>

If you specify shell=True then the first argument of popen should be a string which is what gets parsed by the shell and then eventually run.</description>

      <description>turns out the cheetah python templating engine (2.0 since year 2006) is quite reminiscent of fortran (since the 1950&amp;rsquo;s) in their use of the #slurp directive (cheetah) and the $ string. either one, when appended to the end of a string, remove the implicit newline which usually gets printed. it took me ages to figure out how to suppress newline printing back when i did someone&amp;rsquo;s fortran homework, now i&amp;rsquo;ve had to struggle with it all over again.</description>

      <description>Server Fault, the question and answer forum for systems administrators opened their doors today to the public. It is created by the same notorious bloggers who brought you Stack Overflow, Joel on Software and the Daily WTF.&#xA;Go have a look, ask a question, answer a question and have fun!&#xA;You can hire James and his team at m9rx corporation.

      <description>so the idea was to open this up to sys admins in other mcgill departments, so if we don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, drop us a line and we&amp;rsquo;ll get you added to the blog. if people like the idea, then we&amp;rsquo;ll host this on a better cs machine than dazzle.&#xA;You can hire James and his team at m9rx corporation.

      <description>hello! this blog is intended to be a place where ramblings and discoveries, by and for systems administrators and programmers can be posted and seen by many to ultimately help in the dissemination of useful findings that we wish we had been able to have read here earlier.&#xA;if that didn&amp;rsquo;t make too much sense, perhaps i could rephrase it.&#xA;You can hire James and his team at m9rx corporation.

      <description>Every year on December 25th, a free meal is served to the community. We welcome poor, homeless, lonely, low income, or anyone otherwise in need of a free meal.&#xA;The date coincides with christmas day, but the event is non-religious, and is open to anyone of any faith, including agnostics and atheists.&#xA;The event is run entirely by volunteers using donated time, money and food. We typically serve a meal consisting of turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, cooked vegetables, cranberry sauce, gravy, and dessert.</description>

      <description>I DJ occasionally. Mostly for fun, as I like to put on a good show. I invest almost 100% of my performance fees into paying for show consumables (fire, smoke, bubbles, etc&amp;hellip;) and for buying new equipment to improve the shows.&#xA;I play almost entirely Old School Hip-Hop and Rap, combined with some Break Beats and occasional slow jams.&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to hire me to play at your bar, club, or venue, please contact me.</description>

      <description>Les Garderies K.I.D.S. is a chain of daycares in the Montreal region. I completed a number of projects for this group. Below you can find a select list of projects, some associated photos, and testimonials.&#xA;Video Viewing Screens One of the video viewing screens. Daycare staff needed access to live video streams of different areas of the daycares so that they can keep watch of everything going on. For this I installed a number of PoE cameras alongside custom video viewing screens which were placed around the daycares.</description>

      <description>I run a very small mentoring program. The format has been evolving over time. The program is intended to be very difficult, but fulfilling. Some information about the program can be found on this page.&#xA;I currently offer two streams, each with a different specialization:&#xA;Stream A: Software Engineering &amp;amp; Programming&#xA;Stream B: Systems Administration &amp;amp; DevOps&#xA;I started this program because I was disappointed with the quality of many new hackers these days, and in particular the shift away from strong basic skills.</description>

      <description>Some time ago, I started a small mentoring program, to help interested learners improve their computer skills. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken on a small number of participants to keep quality high, and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve had some great results. Here are some of their testimonials.&#xA;Testimonials When I decided to get back into IT after more than half a decade away from the field, I was in dire need of some direction and James came to the rescue.</description>

      <description>After having spent well over five years using and writing Puppet, I decided that I had some designs for a next generation automation tool. This eventually became what is now known as Mgmt Config or mgmt.&#xA;Mgmt runs as a distributed system. The project has a number of novel features, including an event-based execution engine, a reactive domain specific language (DSL) and the ability to execute in parallel. A cluster of mgmt agents can self-coordinate and run as a distributed system using the raft consensus algorithm.</description>

      <description>What follows is my personal list of what I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to call &amp;ldquo;Open Technical Problems&amp;rdquo;. Each of these items is a description of an open technical problem that I think would be really excellent to have solved. I believe all of these could be reasonably easy to solve if someone has the time, money, and will to do so.&#xA;If you are working on any of these ideas, of if one is solved, please let me know!</description>

      <description>My favourite piece of piano music is called &amp;ldquo;Dorothy&amp;rdquo; by &amp;ldquo;Seymour Smith&amp;rdquo;. My grandmother [1] used to play it to me when I was young. When she died, I asked if I could keep the piano music.&#xA;If you know anything about Seymour Smith, have a copy of any of his sheet music, or would like to send me a recording of Dorothy of any of his other music, please contact me.</description>

      <description>This was intended to be a CAPTCHA for recruiters.&#xA;The CAPTCHA Comment or write a question on one of my technical articles. Contact me. If your comment was good, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a reply back! It need not be long, but you do get points for cleverness if it asks an interesting question, or makes light of a fun corner case that I haven&amp;rsquo;t covered. The clever part about this, is that you get to think of it as a way of quizzing me, and I get to engage with people whose interest is technology.</description>

      <description> An ideal language allows us to express easily what is useful for the programming task, and at the same time makes it difficult to write what leads to incomprehensible or incorrect programs. – Nico Habermann </description>

      <description>yesiscan is a tool for performing automated license scanning. It takes many forms of user input, then runs a bunch of different analysis tools in parallel, and finally produces a customizable report which can easily be shared with your team. It has been designed to make license analysis simple for users, and easy to manage and configure for centralized legal teams.&#xA;yesiscan has a friendly web ui. It can be used via a CLI, web ui, http API, or even imported as a library and built into your existing software.</description>
